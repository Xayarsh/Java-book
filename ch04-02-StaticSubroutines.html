                        <p>
                            Every subroutine in Java must be defined inside
                            some class. This makes Java rather unusual among programming languages, since
                            most languages allow free-floating, independent subroutines. One purpose of a
                            class is to group together related subroutines and variables. Perhaps the
                            designers of Java felt that everything must be related to something. As a less
                            philosophical motivation, Java's designers wanted to place firm controls on the
                            ways things are named, since a Java program potentially has access to a huge
                            number of subroutines created by many different programmers. The fact that those
                            subroutines are grouped into named classes (and classes are grouped into named
                            "packages," as we will see later) helps control the confusion that might result from so many
                            different names.</p>


                        <p>There is a basic distinction in Java between <span class="newword">static</span> and
                            <span class="newword">non-static</span> subroutines.  A class definition can contain the
                            source code for both types of subroutine, but what's done with them when the
                            program runs is very different.  Static subroutines are easier to understand:
                            In a running program, a static subroutine is a member of the class itself.
                            Non-static subroutine definitions, on the other hand, are only there to be used
                            when objects are created, and the subroutines themselves become members of the
                            objects.  Non-static subroutines only become relevant when you are working
                            with objects.  The distinction between static and non-static also applies to variables
                            and to other things that can occur in class definitions.  This chapter will
                            deal with static subroutines and static variables almost exclusively. We'll turn to non-static
                            stuff and to object-oriented programming in the <a href="ch05-00-ObjectsClasses.html">next chapter</a>.</p>


                        <p>A subroutine that is in a class or object is often called a <span class="newword">method</span>,
                            and "method" is the term that most people prefer for
                            subroutines in Java. I will start using the term "method" occasionally,
                            but I will continue to prefer the more general term "subroutine"
                            in this chapter, at least for static subroutines.  However, you should start
                            thinking of the terms "method" and "subroutine" as being essentially
                            synonymous as far as Java is concerned.  Other terms that you might see used to
                            refer to subroutines are "procedures" and "functions."  (I generally use the term
                            "function" only for subroutines that compute and return a value, but in some programming
                            languages, it is used to refer to subroutines in general.)</p>

                        
                        <h3 id="Subroutine Definitions"><a class="header" href="#Subroutine Definitions">Subroutine Definitions</a></h3>

                        <p>A subroutine must be defined somewhere.  The definition has to include the name of the subroutine,
                            enough information to make it possible to call the subroutine, and the code that will be executed
                            each time the subroutine is called.  A subroutine definition in Java takes the form:</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">
<span class="bnf">modifiers</span>  <span class="bnf">return-type</span>  <span class="bnf">subroutine-name</span>  ( <span class="bnf">parameter-list</span> ) {
    <span class="bnf">statements</span>
}</code></pre>


                        <p>It will take us a while&mdash;most of the chapter&mdash;to get through what all
                            this means in detail. Of course, you've already seen examples of subroutines in
                            previous chapters, such as the <span class="code">main()</span> routine of a program and the
                            <span class="code">drawFrame()</span> routine of the animation programs in <a href="ch03-09-GUI.html">Section&nbsp;3.9</a>.
                            So you are familiar with the general format.</p>


                        <p>The <span class="bnf">statements</span> between the braces, { and }, in a subroutine definition
                            make up the <span class="newword">body</span> of the subroutine. These
                            statements are the inside, or implementation part, of the "black box," as
                            discussed in the <a href="ch04-01-BlackBoxes.html">previous section</a>. They are the
                            instructions that the computer executes when the method is called. Subroutines
                            can contain any of the statements discussed in <a href="ch02-00-NameAndThings.html">Chapter&nbsp;2</a> and
                            <a href="ch03-00-Control.html">Chapter&nbsp;3</a>.</p>


                        <p>The <span class="bnf">modifiers</span> that can occur at the
                            beginning of a subroutine definition are words that set certain characteristics
                            of the subroutine, such as whether it is static or not. The modifiers that you've
                            seen so far are "<span class="code">static</span>" and "<span class="code">public</span>". There are only about a
                            half-dozen possible modifiers altogether.</p>


                        <p>If the subroutine is a function, whose job is to compute some value, then
                            the <span class="bnf">return-type</span> is used to specify the type of
                            value that is returned by the function.  It can be a type name such as
                            <span class="classname">String</span> or <span class="ptype">int</span> or even an array type
                            such as <span class="atype">double[]</span>.  We'll be looking at functions and
                            return types in some detail in <a href="ch04-04-ReturnValues.html">Section&nbsp;4.4</a>. If the
                            subroutine is not a function, then the <span class="bnf">return-type</span> is replaced
                            by the special value <span class="code">void</span>,
                            which indicates that no value is returned. The term "void" is meant to indicate
                            that the return value is empty or non-existent.</p>


                        <p>Finally, we come to the <span class="bnf">parameter-list</span> of
                            the method. Parameters are part of the interface of a subroutine. They
                            represent information that is passed into the subroutine from outside, to be
                            used by the subroutine's internal computations. For a concrete example, imagine
                            a class named <span class="classname">Television</span> that includes a method named
                            <span class="code">changeChannel()</span>. The immediate question is: What channel should it
                            change to? A parameter can be used to answer this question. If a channel
                            number is an integer, the type of the parameter would be <span class="ptype">int</span>, and the
                            declaration of the <span class="code">changeChannel()</span> method might look like</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">public void changeChannel(int channelNum) { ... }</code></pre>


                        <p>This declaration specifies that <span class="code">changeChannel()</span> has a parameter
                            named <span class="code">channelNum</span> of type <span class="ptype">int</span>. However, <span class="code">channelNum</span>
                            does not yet have any particular value. A value for <span class="code">channelNum</span> is
                            provided when the subroutine is called; for example:
                            <span class="code">changeChannel(17);</span>
                        </p>


                        <p>The parameter list in a subroutine can be empty, or it can consist of one or
                            more parameter declarations of the form <span class="bnf">type</span>&nbsp;<span class="bnf">parameter-name</span>. If there are several
                            declarations, they are separated by commas. Note that each declaration can name
                            only one parameter. For example, if you want two parameters of type
                            <span class="ptype">double</span>, you have to say "<span class="code">double&nbsp;x,&nbsp;double&nbsp;y</span>", rather than
                            "<span class="code">double&nbsp;x,&nbsp;y</span>".</p>


                        <p>Parameters are covered in more detail in the <a href="ch04-03-Parameters.html">next section</a>.</p>


                        <p>Here are a few examples of subroutine definitions, leaving out the
                            statements that define what the subroutines do:</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">public static void playGame() {
    // "public" and "static" are modifiers; "void" is the 
    // return-type; "playGame" is the subroutine-name; 
    // the parameter-list is empty.
    . . .  // Statements that define what playGame does go here.
}

int getNextN(int N) {
    // There are no modifiers; "int" is the return-type;
    // "getNextN" is the subroutine-name; the parameter-list 
    // includes one parameter whose name is "N" and whose 
    // type is "int".
    . . .  // Statements that define what getNextN does go here.
}

static boolean lessThan(double x, double y) {
    // "static" is a modifier; "boolean" is the
    // return-type; "lessThan" is the subroutine-name; 
    // the parameter-list includes two parameters whose names are 
    // "x" and "y", and the type of each of these parameters 
    // is "double".
    . . .  // Statements that define what lessThan does go here.
}</code></pre>


                        <p>In the second example given here, <span class="code">getNextN</span> is a non-static method,
                            since its definition does not include the modifier "<span class="code">static</span>"&mdash;and so
                            it's not an example that we should be looking at in this chapter! The other
                            modifier shown in the examples is "<span class="code">public</span>". This modifier indicates
                            that the method can be called from anywhere in a program, even from outside the
                            class where the method is defined. There is another modifier,
                            "<span class="code">private</span>", which indicates that the method can be called
                            <b>only</b> from inside the same class. The modifiers <span class="code">public</span>
                            and <span class="code">private</span> are called <span class="newword">access specifiers</span>.
                            If no access specifier is given for a method, then by default, that method can
                            be called from anywhere in the package that contains the class, but not from
                            outside that package. (You will learn more about packages later in this
                            chapter, in <a href="ch04-06-APIPackagesModulesJavadoc.html">Section&nbsp;4.6</a>.)  There is one other access
                            modifier, <span class="code">protected</span>, which will only become relevant when we turn to
                            object-oriented programming in <a href="ch05-00-ObjectsClasses.html">Chapter&nbsp;5</a>.</p>


                        <p>Note, by the way, that the <span class="code">main()</span> routine of a program follows the
                            usual syntax rules for a subroutine. In</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">public static void main(String[] args) { ... }</code></pre>


                        <p>the modifiers are <span class="code">public</span> and <span class="code">static</span>, the return type is
                            <span class="code">void</span>, the subroutine name is <span class="code">main</span>, and the parameter list is
                            "<span class="code">String[]&nbsp;args</span>".  In this case, the type for the parameter is
                            the array type <span class="atype">String[]</span>.</p>


                        <p>You've already had some experience with filling in the implementation of a
                            subroutine. In this chapter, you'll learn all about writing your own complete
                            subroutine definitions, including the interface part.</p>

                        
                        <h3 id="Calling Subroutines"><a class="header" href="#Calling Subroutines">Calling Subroutines</a></h3>


                        <p>When you define a subroutine, all you are doing is telling the computer that
                            the subroutine exists and what it does. The subroutine doesn't actually get
                            executed until it is called. (This is true even for the <span class="code">main()</span> routine
                            in a class&mdash;even though <b>you</b> don't call it, it is called by
                            the system when the system runs your program.) For example, the
                            <span class="code">playGame()</span> method given as an example above could be called using the following
                            subroutine call statement:</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">playGame();</code></pre>


                        <p>This statement could occur anywhere in the same class that includes the
                            definition of <span class="code">playGame()</span>, whether in a <span class="code">main()</span> method or in
                            some other subroutine. Since <span class="code">playGame()</span> is a <span class="code">public</span> method,
                            it can also be called from other classes, but in that case, you have to tell
                            the computer which class it comes from.  Since <span class="code">playGame()</span> is a <span class="code">static</span> method,
                            its full name includes the name of the class in which it is defined.  Let's say, for example, that
                            <span class="code">playGame()</span> is defined in a class named <span class="code">Poker</span>. Then to call
                            <span class="code">playGame()</span> from <b>outside</b> the <span class="code">Poker</span> class, you would
                            have to say</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">Poker.playGame();</code></pre>


                        <p>The use of the class name here tells the computer which class to look in to
                            find the method.  It also lets you distinguish between <span class="code">Poker.playGame()</span>
                            and other potential <span class="code">playGame()</span> methods defined in other classes, such
                            as <span class="code">Roulette.playGame()</span> or <span class="code">Blackjack.playGame()</span>.</p>


                        <p>More generally, a <span class="newword">subroutine call statement</span> for a <span class="code">static</span>
                            subroutine takes the form</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">
<span class="bnf">subroutine-name</span>(<span class="bnf">parameters</span>);</code></pre>


                        <p>if the subroutine that is being called is in the same class, or</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">
<span class="bnf">class-name</span>.<span class="bnf">subroutine-name</span>(<span class="bnf">parameters</span>);</code></pre>


                        <p>if the subroutine is defined elsewhere, in a different
                            class. (Non-static methods belong to objects rather than classes, and they are
                            called using objects instead of class names. More on that later.) Note
                            that the parameter list can be empty, as in the <span class="code">playGame()</span> example,
                            but the parentheses must be there even if there is nothing between them.
                            The number of parameters that you provide when you call a subroutine must
                            match the number specified in the parameter list in the subroutine definition,
                            and the types of the parameters in the call statement must match the types
                            in the subroutine definition.</p>

                        <h3 id="Subroutines in Programs"><a class="header" href="#Subroutines in Programs">Subroutines in Programs</a></h3>

                        <p>It's time to give an example of what a complete program looks like, when it
                            includes other subroutines in addition to the <span class="code">main()</span> routine. Let's
                            write a program that plays a guessing game with the user. The computer will
                            choose a random number between 1 and 100, and the user will try to guess it.
                            The computer tells the user whether the guess is high or low or correct. If the
                            user gets the number after six guesses or fewer, the user wins the game. After
                            each game, the user has the option of continuing with another game.</p>


                        <p>Since playing one game can be thought of as a single, coherent task, it
                            makes sense to write a subroutine that will play one guessing game with the
                            user. The <span class="code">main()</span> routine will use a loop to call the
                            <span class="code">playGame()</span> subroutine over and over, as many times as the user wants
                            to play. We approach the problem of designing the <span class="code">playGame()</span>
                            subroutine the same way we write a <span class="code">main()</span> routine: Start with an
                            outline of the algorithm and apply stepwise refinement. Here is a short
                            pseudocode algorithm for a guessing game routine:</p>


                        <pre><code class="plain-text">Pick a random number
while the game is not over:
    Get the user's guess
    Tell the user whether the guess is high, low, or correct.</code></pre>


                        <p>The test for whether the game is over is complicated, since the game ends if
                            either the user makes a correct guess or the number of guesses is six. As in
                            many cases, the easiest thing to do is to use a "<span class="code">while&nbsp;(true)</span>" loop
                            and use <span class="code">break</span> to end the loop whenever we find a reason to do so.
                            Also, if we are going to end the game after six guesses, we'll have to keep
                            track of the number of guesses that the user has made. Filling out the
                            algorithm gives:</p>


                        <pre><code class="plain-text">Let computersNumber be a random number between 1 and 100
Let guessCount = 0
while (true):
    Get the user's guess
    Count the guess by adding 1 to guess count
    if the user's guess equals computersNumber:
        Tell the user he won
        break out of the loop
    if the number of guesses is 6:
        Tell the user he lost
        break out of the loop
    if the user's guess is less than computersNumber:
        Tell the user the guess was low
    else if the user's guess is higher than computersNumber:
        Tell the user the guess was high</code></pre>


                        <p>With variable declarations added and translated into Java, this becomes the
                            definition of the <span class="code">playGame()</span> routine. A random integer between 1 and
                            100 can be computed as <span class="code">(int)(100&nbsp;* Math.random())&nbsp;+&nbsp;1</span>. I've cleaned up
                            the interaction with the user to make it flow better.</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">static void playGame() {
    int computersNumber; // A random number picked by the computer.
    int usersGuess;      // A number entered by user as a guess.
    int guessCount;      // Number of guesses the user has made.
    computersNumber = (int)(100 * Math.random()) + 1;
             // The value assigned to computersNumber is a randomly
             //    chosen integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.
    guessCount = 0;
    System.out.println();
    System.out.print("What is your first guess? ");
    while (true) {
       usersGuess = TextIO.getInt();  // Get the user's guess.
       guessCount++;
       if (usersGuess == computersNumber) {
          System.out.println("You got it in " + guessCount
                  + " guesses!  My number was " + computersNumber);
          break;  // The game is over; the user has won.
       }
       if (guessCount == 6) {
          System.out.println("You didn't get the number in 6 guesses.");
          System.out.println("You lose.  My number was " + computersNumber);
          break;  // The game is over; the user has lost.
       }
       // If we get to this point, the game continues.
       // Tell the user if the guess was too high or too low.
       if (usersGuess &lt; computersNumber)
          System.out.print("That's too low.  Try again: ");
       else if (usersGuess &gt; computersNumber)
          System.out.print("That's too high.  Try again: ");
    }
    System.out.println();
} // end of playGame()</code></pre>


                        <p>Now, where exactly should you put this? It should be part of the same class
                            as the <span class="code">main()</span> routine, but <b>not</b> inside the main routine. It is not
                            legal to have one subroutine physically nested inside another. The
                            <span class="code">main()</span> routine will <b>call</b> <span class="code">playGame()</span>; it will
                            <b>not</b> contain the definition of <span class="code">playGame</span>.
                            You can put the definition of <span class="code">playGame()</span> either before
                            or after the <span class="code">main()</span> routine. Java is not very picky about having the
                            subroutine definitions in a class in any particular order.</p>


                        <p>It's pretty easy to write the main routine. You've done things like this
                            before. Here's what the complete program looks like (except that a serious
                            program needs more comments than I've included here).</p>

                        <p>Take some time to read the program carefully and figure out how it works.
                            And try to convince yourself that even in this relatively simple case, breaking
                            up the program into two methods makes the program easier to understand and
                            probably made it easier to write each piece.</p>
                        
                        <h3 id="Member Variables"><a class="header" href="#Member Variables">Member Variables</a></h3>

                        <p>A class can include other things besides subroutines. In particular, it can
                            also include variable declarations. Of course, you can declare variables
                            <b>inside</b> subroutines.  Those are called <span class="newword">local variables.</span>
                            However, you can also have variables that are
                            not part of any subroutine. To distinguish such variables from local variables,
                            we call them <span class="newword">member variables</span>, since they are
                            members of a class.  Another term for them is <span class="newword">global variable</span>.</p>


                        <p>Just as with subroutines, member variables can be either static or
                            non-static. In this chapter, we'll stick to static variables. A static member
                            variable belongs to the class as a whole, and it exists as long as the class
                            exists. Memory is allocated for the variable when the class is first loaded by
                            the Java interpreter. Any assignment statement that assigns a value to the
                            variable changes the content of that memory, no matter where that assignment
                            statement is located in the program. Any time the variable is used in an
                            expression, the value is fetched from that same memory, no matter where the
                            expression is located in the program. This means that the value of a static
                            member variable can be set in one subroutine and used in another subroutine.
                            Static member variables are "shared" by all the static subroutines in the
                            class. A local variable in a subroutine, on the other hand, exists only while
                            that subroutine is being executed, and is completely inaccessible from outside
                            that one subroutine.</p>


                        <p>The declaration of a member variable looks just like the declaration of a
                            local variable except for two things: The member variable is declared outside
                            any subroutine (although it still has to be inside a class), and the
                            declaration can be marked with modifiers such as <span class="code">static</span>,
                            <span class="code">public</span>, and <span class="code">private</span>. Since we are only working with static
                            member variables for now, every declaration of a member variable in this
                            chapter will include the modifier <span class="code">static</span>.  They might also
                            be marked as <span class="code">public</span> or <span class="code">private</span>.  For example:</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">static String usersName;
public static int numberOfPlayers;
private static double velocity, time;</code></pre>


                        <p>A static member variable that is not declared to be <span class="code">private</span> can be
                            accessed from outside the class where it is defined, as well as inside. When it
                            is used in some other class, it must be referred to with a compound identifier
                            of the form <span class="bnf">class-name</span>.<span class="bnf">variable-name</span>. For example, the <span class="classname">System</span> class
                            contains the public static member variable named <span class="code">out</span>, and you use this
                            variable in your own classes by referring to <span class="code">System.out</span>.   Similarly,
                            <span class="code">Math.PI</span> is a public static member variable in the <span class="classname">Math</span> class.  If
                            <span class="code">numberOfPlayers</span> is a public static member variable in a class named
                            <span class="code">Poker</span>, then code in the <span class="code">Poker</span> class would refer to it
                            simply as <span class="code">numberOfPlayers</span>, while code in another class would refer to
                            it as <span class="code">Poker.numberOfPlayers</span>.</p>


                        <p>As an example, let's add a couple of static member variables to the
                            <span class="code">GuessingGame</span> class that we wrote earlier in this section.
                            We add a variable named <span class="code">gamesPlayed</span> to keep track of how
                            many games the user has played and another variable named <span class="code">gamesWon</span>
                            to keep track of the number of games that the user has won.  The variables
                            are declared as static member variables:</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">static int gamesPlayed;
static int gamesWon;</code></pre>


                        <p>In the <span class="code">playGame()</span> routine, we always add 1 to <span class="code">gamesPlayed</span>,
                            and we add 1 to  <span class="code">gamesWon</span> if the user wins the game.
                            At the end of the <span class="code">main()</span> routine, we print out the values of both variables.
                            It would be impossible to
                            do the same thing with local variables, since both subroutines need to access the variables,
                            and local variables exist in only one subroutine.  Furthermore, global variables keep
                            their values between one subroutine call and the next. Local variables do not; a local
                            variable gets a new value each time that the subroutine that contains it is called.</p>


                        <p>When you declare a local variable in a subroutine, you have to assign a
                            value to that variable before you can do anything with it. Member variables, on
                            the other hand are automatically initialized with a default value.  The default
                            values are the same as those that are used when initializing the elements of an array:
                            For numeric variables, the default value is zero; for <span class="ptype">boolean</span> variables, the
                            default is <span class="code">false</span>; for <span class="ptype">char</span> variables, it's the
                            character that has Unicode code number zero; and for objects, such as
                            <span class="classname">Strings</span>, the default initial value is the special value
                            <span class="code">null</span>.</p>


                        <p>Since they are of type <span class="ptype">int</span>, the static member variables <span class="code">gamesPlayed</span>
                            and <span class="code">gamesWon</span> automatically get zero as their initial value. This
                            happens to be the correct initial value for a variable that is being used as a
                            counter. You can, of course, assign a value to a variable at the
                            beginning of the <span class="code">main()</span> routine if you are not satisfied with the
                            default initial value, or if you want to make the initial value more explicit.</p>

                        <blockquote>
                        <p>I didn't mark the static subroutines
                            or variables as being <span class="code">public</span> or <span class="code">private</span>.  Recall that global variables and subroutines
                            with no access modifier
                            can be used anywhere in the same package as the class where they are defined, but not in
                            other packages. Classes that
                            don't declare a package are in the default package.  So, any class in the default package
                            would have access to <span class="code">gamesPlayed</span>, <span class="code">gamesWon</span>, and
                            <span class="code">playGame()</span>&mdash;and that includes most of the classes in this book.  In fact,
                            it is considered to be good practice
                            to make member variables and subroutines <span class="code">private</span>, unless
                            there is a reason for doing otherwise.</p>
