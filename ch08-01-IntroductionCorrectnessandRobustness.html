                        <p>
                            A program is <span class="newword">correct</span>
                            if it accomplishes the task that it was designed to perform.
                            It is <span class="newword">robust</span> if it can handle illegal inputs and other unexpected
                            situations in a reasonable way. For example, consider a program that is
                            designed to read some numbers from the user and then print the same numbers in
                            sorted order. The program is correct if it works for any set of input numbers.
                            It is robust if it can also deal with non-numeric input by, for example,
                            printing an error message and ignoring the bad input. A non-robust program
                            might crash or give nonsensical output in the same circumstance.</p>


                        <p>Every program should be correct. (A sorting program that doesn't sort
                            correctly is pretty useless.) It's not the case that every program needs to be
                            completely robust. It depends on who will use it and how it will be used. For
                            example, a small utility program that you write for your own use doesn't have
                            to be particularly robust.</p>


                        <p>The question of correctness is actually more subtle than it might appear. A
                            programmer works from a specification of what the program is supposed to do.
                            The programmer's work is correct if the program meets its specification. But
                            does that mean that the program itself is correct? What if the specification is
                            incorrect or incomplete? A correct program should be a correct implementation
                            of a complete and correct specification. The question is whether the
                            specification correctly expresses the intention and desires of the people for
                            whom the program is being written. This is a question that lies largely outside
                            the domain of computer science.</p>


                        <h3 id="Horror Stories"><a class="header" href="#Horror Stories">Horror Stories</a></h3>

                        <p>Most computer users have personal experience with programs that don't work
                            or that crash. In many cases, such problems are just annoyances, but even on a
                            personal computer there can be more serious consequences, such as lost work or
                            lost money. When computers are given more important tasks, the consequences of
                            failure can be proportionately more serious.</p>


                        <p>About twenty-three years ago, the failure of two multi-million dollar space missions to
                            Mars was prominent in the news. Both failures were probably due to software
                            problems, but in both cases the problem was not with an incorrect program as
                            such. In September 1999, the Mars Climate Orbiter burned up in the Martian
                            atmosphere because data that was expressed in English units of measurement
                            (such as feet and pounds) was entered into a computer program that was designed
                            to use metric units (such as centimeters and grams). A few months later, the
                            Mars Polar Lander probably crashed because its software turned off its landing
                            engines too soon. The program was supposed to detect the bump when the
                            spacecraft landed and turn off the engines then. It has been determined that
                            deployment of the landing gear might have jarred the spacecraft enough to
                            activate the program, causing it to turn off the engines when the spacecraft
                            was still high above the ground. The unpowered spacecraft would then have fallen to the
                            Martian surface. A more robust system would have checked the altitude before
                            turning off the engines!</p>


                        <p>There are many equally dramatic stories of problems caused by incorrect or
                            poorly written software. Let's look at a few incidents recounted in the book
                            <i>Computer Ethics</i> by Tom Forester and Perry Morrison. (This book
                            covers various ethical issues in computing. It, or something like it, is
                            essential reading for any student of computer science.)</p>


                        <ul>

                            <li>In 1985 and 1986, one person was killed and several were injured by excess
                                radiation, while undergoing radiation treatments by a mis-programmed
                                computerized radiation machine. In another case, over a ten-year period ending
                                in 1992, almost 1,000 cancer patients received radiation dosages that were 30%
                                less than prescribed because of a programming error.</li>

                            <li>In 1985, a computer at the Bank of New York started destroying records of
                                on-going security transactions because of an error in a program. It took less
                                than 24 hours to fix the program, but by that time, the bank was out $5,000,000
                                in overnight interest payments on funds that it had to borrow to cover the
                                problem.</li>

                            <li>The programming of the inertial guidance system of the F-16 fighter plane
                                would have turned the plane upside-down when it crossed the equator, if the
                                problem had not been discovered in simulation. The Mariner 18 space probe was
                                lost because of an error in one line of a program. The Gemini V space capsule
                                missed its scheduled landing target by a hundred miles, because a programmer
                                forgot to take into account the rotation of the Earth.</li>

                            <li>In 1990, AT&amp;T's long-distance telephone service was disrupted throughout
                                the United States when a newly loaded computer program proved to contain a
                                bug.</li>

                        </ul>


                        <p>Of course, there have been more recent problems.  For example,
                            computer software error contributed to the
                            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_Blackout_of_2003">Northeast&nbsp;Blackout</a>
                            of 2003, one of the largest power outages in history.
                            In 2006, the Airbus A380 was <a href="http://www.cadalyst.com/cad/product-design/what-grounded-airbus-a380-10903">delayed</a>
                            by software incompatibility problems, at a cost of perhaps billions of dollars.
                            In 2007, a software problem grounded thousands of planes at the Los Angeles International Airport.
                            On May 6, 2010,
                            a flaw in an automatic trading program apparently
                            <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9189179/Regulators_blame_computer_algorithm_for_stock_market_flash_crash_">resulted&nbsp;in</a> a 1000-point drop
                            in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.</p>


                        <p>These are just a few examples. Software problems are all too common. As
                            programmers, we need to understand why that is true and what can be done about
                            it.</p>


                        <h3 id="Java to the Rescue"><a class="header" href="#Java to the Rescue">Java to the Rescue</a></h3>

                        <p>Part of the problem, according to the inventors of Java, can be traced to
                            programming languages themselves. Java was designed to provide some protection
                            against certain types of errors. How can a language feature help prevent
                            errors? Let's look at a few examples.</p>


                        <p>Some programming languages do not require variables to be declared. In
                            such languages, when a variable name is used in a program, the variable is
                            created automatically. You might consider this more convenient than having to
                            declare every variable explicitly, but there is an unfortunate consequence: An
                            inadvertent spelling error might introduce an extra variable that you had no
                            intention of creating. This type of error was responsible, according to one
                            famous story, for yet another lost spacecraft. In the <span class="code">FORTRAN</span>
                            programming language, the command "<span class="code">DO 20 I = 1,5</span>" is the first
                            statement of a counting loop. Now, spaces are insignificant in <span class="code">FORTRAN</span>, so this
                            is equivalent to "<span class="code">DO20I=1,5</span>". On the other hand, the command
                            "<span class="code">DO20I=1.5</span>", with a period instead of a comma, is an assignment
                            statement that assigns the value <span class="code">1.5</span> to the variable <span class="code">DO20I</span>.
                            Supposedly, the inadvertent substitution of a period for a comma in a statement
                            of this type caused a rocket to blow up on take-off. Because <span class="code">FORTRAN</span>
                            doesn't require variables to be declared, the compiler would be happy to accept
                            the statement "<span class="code">DO20I=1.5</span>." It would just create a new variable named
                            <span class="code">DO20I</span>. If <span class="code">FORTRAN</span> required variables to be declared, the
                            compiler would have complained that the variable <span class="code">DO20I</span> was
                            undeclared.</p>


                        <p>While most programming languages today do require variables to be declared,
                            there are other features in common programming languages that can cause
                            problems. Java has eliminated some of these features. Some people complain that
                            this makes Java less efficient and less powerful. While there is some justice
                            in this criticism, the increase in security and robustness is probably worth
                            the cost in most circumstances. The best defense against some types of errors
                            is to design a programming language in which the errors are impossible. In
                            other cases, where the error can't be completely eliminated, the language can
                            be designed so that when the error does occur, it will automatically be
                            detected. This will at least prevent the error from causing further harm, and
                            it will alert the programmer that there is a bug that needs fixing. Let's look
                            at a few cases where the designers of Java have taken these approaches.</p>


                        <p>An array is created with a certain number of locations, numbered from zero
                            up to some specified maximum index. It is an error to try to use an array
                            location that is outside of the specified range. In Java, any attempt to do so
                            is detected automatically by the system. In some other languages, such as C and
                            C++, it's up to the programmer to make sure that the index is within the legal
                            range. Suppose that an array, <span class="code">A</span>, has three locations, <span class="code">A[0]</span>,
                            <span class="code">A[1]</span>, and <span class="code">A[2]</span>. Then <span class="code">A[3]</span>, <span class="code">A[4]</span>, and so on
                            refer to memory locations beyond the end of the array. In Java, an attempt to
                            store data in <span class="code">A[3]</span> will be detected. The program will be terminated
                            (unless the error is "caught", as discussed in <a href="ch03-07-ExceptionsTryCatch.html">Section&nbsp;3.7</a>).
                            In C or C++, the computer will just go ahead and store the data in
                            memory that is not part of the array. Since there is no telling what that
                            memory location is being used for, the result will be unpredictable. The
                            consequences could be much more serious than a terminated program. (See, for
                            example, the discussion of buffer overflow errors later in this section.)</p>


                        <p>Pointers are a notorious source of programming errors. In Java, a variable
                            of object type holds either a pointer to an object or the special value
                            <span class="code">null</span>. Any attempt to use a <span class="code">null</span> value as if it were a pointer
                            to an actual object will be detected by the system. In some other languages,
                            again, it's up to the programmer to avoid such null pointer errors. In my first
                            Macintosh computer, a long time ago, a <span class="code">null</span> pointer was actually implemented as if it
                            were a pointer to memory location zero. A program could use a null pointer to
                            change values stored in memory near location zero. Unfortunately, the Macintosh
                            stored important system data in those locations. Changing that data could cause
                            the whole system to crash, a consequence more severe than a single failed
                            program.</p>


                        <p>Another type of pointer error occurs when a pointer value is pointing to an
                            object of the wrong type or to a segment of memory that does not even hold a
                            valid object at all. These types of errors are impossible in Java, which does
                            not allow programmers to manipulate pointers directly. In other languages, it
                            is possible to set a pointer to point, essentially, to any location in memory.
                            If this is done incorrectly, then using the pointer can have unpredictable
                            results.</p>


                        <p>Another type of error that cannot occur in Java is a memory leak. In Java,
                            once there are no longer any pointers that refer to an object, that object is
                            "garbage collected" so that the memory that it occupied can be reused. In other
                            languages, it is the programmer's responsibility to return unused memory to the
                            system. If the programmer fails to do this, unused memory can build up, leaving
                            less memory for programs and data. There is a story that many common programs
                            for older Windows computers had so many memory leaks that the computer would run out
                            of memory after a few days of use and would have to be restarted.</p>


                        <p>Many programs have been found to suffer from <span class="newword">buffer overflow errors</span>.
                            Buffer overflow errors often make the news because they
                            are responsible for many network security problems. When one computer receives
                            data from another computer over a network, that data is stored in a buffer. The
                            buffer is just a segment of memory that has been allocated by a program to hold
                            data that it expects to receive. A buffer overflow occurs when more data is
                            received than will fit in the buffer. The question is, what happens then? If
                            the error is detected by the program or by the networking software, then the
                            only thing that has happened is a failed network data transmission. The real
                            problem occurs when the software does not properly detect buffer overflows. In
                            that case, the software continues to store data in memory even after the buffer
                            is filled, and the extra data goes into some part of memory that was not
                            allocated by the program as part of the buffer. That memory might be in use for
                            some other purpose. It might contain important data. It might even contain part
                            of the program itself. This is where the real security issues come in. Suppose
                            that a buffer overflow causes part of a program to be replaced with extra data
                            received over a network. When the computer goes to execute the part of the
                            program that was replaced, it's actually executing data that was received from
                            another computer. That data could be anything. It could be a program that
                            crashes the computer or takes it over. A malicious programmer who finds a
                            convenient buffer overflow error in networking software can try to exploit that
                            error to trick other computers into executing his programs.</p>


                        <p>For software written completely in Java, buffer overflow errors are
                            impossible. The language simply does not provide any way to store data into
                            memory that has not been properly allocated. To do that, you would need a
                            pointer that points to unallocated memory or you would have to refer to an
                            array location that lies outside the range allocated for the array. As
                            explained above, neither of these is possible in Java. (However, there could
                            conceivably still be errors in Java's standard classes, since some of the
                            methods in these classes are actually written in the C programming language
                            rather than in Java.  In fact, Java's internal security errors have at
                            times been a problem for the language.)</p>


                        <p>It's clear that language design can help prevent errors or detect them when
                            they occur. Doing so involves restricting what a programmer is allowed to do.
                            Or it requires tests, such as checking whether a pointer is <span class="code">null</span>, that
                            take some extra processing time. Some programmers feel that the sacrifice of
                            power and efficiency is too high a price to pay for the extra security. In some
                            applications, this is true. However, there are many situations where safety and
                            security are primary considerations. Java is designed for such situations.</p>

                        <h3 id="Problems Remain in Java"><a class="header" href="#Problems Remain in Java">Problems Remain in Java</a></h3>


                        <p>There is one area where the designers of Java chose not to detect errors
                            automatically: numerical computations. In Java, a value of type <span class="ptype">int</span> is
                            represented as a 32-bit binary number. With 32 bits, it's possible to represent
                            a little over four billion different values. The values of type <span class="ptype">int</span>
                            range from -2147483648 to 2147483647. What happens when the result of a
                            computation lies outside this range? For example, what is
                            <span class="code">2147483647&nbsp;+&nbsp;1</span>? And what is <span class="code">2000000000&nbsp;*&nbsp;2</span>? The
                            mathematically correct result in each case cannot be represented as a value of
                            type <span class="ptype">int</span>. These are examples of <span class="newword">integer overflow</span>.
                            In most cases, integer overflow should be considered an error.
                            However, Java does not automatically detect such errors. For example, it will
                            compute the value of <span class="code">2147483647&nbsp;+&nbsp;1</span> to be the negative number,
                            <span class="code">-2147483648</span>. (What happens is that any extra bits beyond the 32-nd bit in the
                            correct answer are discarded. Values greater than 2147483647 will "wrap around"
                            to negative values. Mathematically speaking, the result is always "correct
                            modulo 2<sup>32</sup>.")</p>


                        <p>For example, consider the 3N+1 program, which was discussed in
                            <a href="ch03-02-AlgorithmDevelopment.html">Subsection&nbsp;3.2.2</a>. Starting from a positive integer
                            <span class="code">N</span>, the program computes a certain sequence of integers:</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">while ( N != 1 ) {
   if ( N % 2 == 0 )  // If N is even...
      N = N / 2;
   else
      N = 3 * N + 1;
   System.out.println(N);
}</code></pre>


                        <p>But there is a problem here: If <span class="code">N</span> is too large, then the value of
                            <span class="code">3*N+1</span> will not be mathematically correct because of integer overflow.
                            The problem arises whenever <span class="code">3*N+1 &gt; 2147483647</span>, that is when <span class="code">N
&gt; 2147483646/3</span>. For a completely correct program, we should check for
                            this possibility <b>before</b> computing <span class="code">3*N+1</span>:</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">while ( N != 1 ) {
   if ( N % 2 == 0 )  // If N is even...
      N = N / 2;
   else {
      if (N &gt; 2147483646/3) {
         System.out.println("Sorry, but the value of N has become");
         System.out.println("too large for your computer!");
         break;
      }
      N = 3 * N + 1;
   }
   System.out.println(N);
}</code></pre>


                        <p>(Be sure you understand why we can't just test "<span class="code">if (3*N+1 &gt; 2147483647)</span>".)
                            The problem here is not that the original algorithm for computing
                            <span class="code">3N+1</span> sequences was wrong. The problem is that it just can't be
                            correctly implemented using 32-bit integers. Many programs ignore this type of
                            problem. But integer overflow errors have been responsible for their share of
                            serious computer failures, and a completely robust program should take the
                            possibility of integer overflow into account. (The infamous "Y2K" bug at the start of
                            the year 2000 was, in fact, just this sort of error.)</p>


                        <p>For numbers of type <span class="ptype">double</span>, there are even more problems. There are
                            still overflow errors, which occur when the result of a computation is outside
                            the range of values that can be represented as a value of type <span class="ptype">double</span>.
                            This range extends up to about 1.7 times 10 to the power 308. Numbers beyond
                            this range do not "wrap around" to negative values. Instead, they are
                            represented by special values that have no real numerical equivalent. The special values
                            <span class="code">Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY</span> and <span class="code">Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY</span>
                            represent numbers outside the range of legal values. For example, <span class="code">20&nbsp;*&nbsp;1e308</span> is
                            computed to be <span class="code">Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY</span>. Another special value of type
                            <span class="ptype">double</span>, <span class="code">Double.NaN</span>, represents an illegal or undefined
                            result. ("NaN" stands for "Not a Number".) For example, the result of dividing zero
                            by zero or taking the square root of a negative number is <span class="code">Double.NaN</span>.
                            You can test whether a number <span class="code">x</span> is this special not-a-number value by
                            calling the <span class="ptype">boolean</span>-valued function <span class="code">Double.isNaN(x)</span>.</p>


                        <p>For real numbers, there is the added complication that most real numbers can
                            only be represented approximately on a computer. A real number can have an
                            infinite number of digits after the decimal point. A value of type
                            <span class="ptype">double</span> is only accurate to about 15 digits. The real number 1/3, for
                            example, is the repeating decimal <span class="code">0.333333333333...</span>, and there is no way to
                            represent it exactly using a finite number of digits. Computations with real
                            numbers generally involve a loss of accuracy. In fact, if care is not
                            exercised, the result of a large number of such computations might be
                            completely wrong! There is a whole field of computer science, known as
                            <span class="newword">numerical analysis</span>, which is devoted to studying
                            algorithms that manipulate real numbers.</p>



                        <p>So you see that not all possible errors are avoided or detected automatically in Java.
                            Furthermore, even when an error is detected automatically, the system's default response is
                            to report the error and terminate the program. This is hardly robust behavior!
                            So, a Java programmer still needs to learn techniques for avoiding and dealing with
                            errors. These are the main topics of the next three sections.</p>
