                        <p>
                            Object-oriented programming (OOP) represents an
                            attempt to make programs more closely model the way people think about and deal
                            with the world. In the older styles of programming, a programmer who is faced
                            with some problem must identify a computing task that needs to be performed in
                            order to solve the problem. Programming then consists of finding a sequence of
                            instructions that will accomplish that task. But at the heart of
                            object-oriented programming, instead of tasks we find objects&mdash;entities that
                            have behaviors, that hold information, and that can interact with one another.
                            Programming consists of designing a set of objects that somehow model the
                            problem at hand. Software objects in the program can represent real or abstract
                            entities in the problem domain. This is supposed to make the design of the
                            program more natural and hence easier to get right and easier to
                            understand.</p>


                        <p>To some extent, OOP is just a change in point of view. We can think of an
                            object in standard programming terms as nothing more than a set of variables
                            together with some subroutines for manipulating those variables. In fact, it is
                            possible to use object-oriented techniques in any programming language.
                            However, there is a big difference between a language that makes OOP possible
                            and one that actively supports it. An object-oriented programming language such
                            as Java includes a number of features that make it very different from a
                            standard language. In order to make effective use of those features, you have
                            to "orient" your thinking correctly.</p>


                        <p>As I have mentioned before, in the context of object-oriented programming,
                            subroutines are often referred to as <span class="newword">methods</span>.  Now that
                            we are starting to use objects, I will be using the term "method" more often
                            than "subroutine."</p>

                       <h3 id="Objects, Classes, and Instances"><a class="header" href="#Objects, Classes, and Instances">Objects, Classes, and Instances</a></h3>


                        <p>Objects are closely related to classes. We have already been working with
                            classes for several chapters, and we have seen that a class can contain
                            variables and methods (that is, subroutines). If an object is also a collection of variables and
                            methods, how do they differ from classes? And why does it require a
                            different type of thinking to understand and use them effectively? In the one
                            section where we worked with objects rather than classes,
                            <a href="ch03-09-GUI.html">Section&nbsp;3.9</a>, it didn't seem to make much difference: We
                            just left the word "<span class="code">static</span>" out of the subroutine definitions!</p>


                        <p>I have said that classes "describe" objects, or more exactly that the
                            non-static portions of classes describe objects. But it's probably not very
                            clear what this means. The more usual terminology is to say that objects
                            <span class="newword">belong to</span> classes, but this might not be much
                            clearer. (There is a real shortage of English words to properly distinguish all
                            the concepts involved. An object certainly doesn't "belong" to a class in the
                            same way that a member variable "belongs" to a class.) From the point of view
                            of programming, it is more exact to say that classes are used to create
                            objects. A class is a kind of factory&mdash;or blueprint&mdash;for constructing objects. The non-static
                            parts of the class specify, or describe, what variables and methods the
                            objects will contain. This is part of the explanation of how objects differ
                            from classes: Objects are created and destroyed as the program runs, and there
                            can be many objects with the same structure, if they are created using the same
                            class.</p>


                        <p>Consider a simple class whose job is to group together a few static member
                            variables. For example, the following class could be used to store information
                            about the person who is using the program:</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">class UserData {
    static String name;
    static int age;
}</code></pre>


                        <p>In a program that uses this class, there is only one copy of each of the
                            variables <span class="code">UserData.name</span> and <span class="code">UserData.age</span>.  When the class is
                            loaded into the computer, there is a section of memory devoted to the class, and
                            that section of memory includes space for the values of the variables <span class="code">name</span>
                            and <span class="code">age.</span>  We can picture the class in memory as looking like this:</p>


                        <p align="center">
                            <img src="./images/class-userdata.png" width="165" height="128" alt="the UserData class in memory, with space for name and age"></p>


                        <p>An important point is that the static member variables are part of the representation
                            of the class in memory.
                            Their full names, <span class="code">UserData.name</span> and <span class="code">UserData.age</span>,
                            use the name of the class, since they are part of the class.
                            When we use class <span class="classname">UserData</span> to represent the user of the program,
                            there can only be <b>one</b> user, since we only have memory space to store data about one user. Note that
                            the class, <span class="code">UserData</span>, and the variables it contains exist as long as the
                            program runs. (That is essentially what it means to be "static.")
                            Now, consider a similar class that includes some non-static variables:</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">class PlayerData {
   static int playerCount;
   String name;
   int age;
}</code></pre>


                        <p>I've also included a static variable in the <span class="classname">PlayerData</span> class.
                            Here, the static variable <span class="code">playerCount</span> is stored as part of the representation of the class in memory.
                            Its full name is <span class="code">PlayerData.playerCount</span>, and there is only one of it, which exists
                            as long as the program runs.  However, the other two variables in the class definition are non-static.
                            There is no such variable as <span class="code">PlayerData.name</span> or
                            <span class="code">PlayerData.age</span>, since non-static variables do not become part of the
                            class itself.  But the <span class="classname">PlayerData</span> class can
                            be used to create objects.   There can be many objects created using the class, and each
                            one will have its <b>own</b> variables called <span class="code">name</span> and <span class="code">age</span>.
                            This is what it means for the non-static parts of the class to be a template for objects:
                            Every object gets its own copy of the non-static part of the class.  We can visualize
                            the situation in the computer's memory after several objects have been created like this:</p>



                        <p align="center">
                            <img src="./images/instance-of-PlayerData.png" width="573" height="358" alt="the PlayerData class and three objects in memory"></p>


                        <p>Note that the static variable <span class="code">playerCount</span> is part of the class, and there
                            is only one copy.  On the other hand, every object contains a <span class="code">name</span> and an
                            <span class="code">age</span>.  An object that is created from a class is called an <span class="newword">instance</span> of
                            that class, and as the picture shows, every object "knows" which class was used to create it.
                            I've shown class <span class="classname">PlayerData</span> as containing something called a
                            "constructor;" the constructor is a subroutine that creates objects.</p>


                        <p>Now there can
                            be many "players," because we can make new objects to represent new players on
                            demand.  A program might use the <span class="classname">PlayerData</span> class to store information about multiple
                            players in a game. Each player has a name and an age. When a player joins the
                            game, a new <span class="code">PlayerData</span> object can be created to represent that player.
                            If a player leaves the game, the <span class="code">PlayerData</span> object that represents
                            that player can be destroyed. A system of objects in the program is being used
                            to <span class="newword">dynamically</span> model what is happening in the game.
                            You can't do this with static variables!  "Dynamic" is the opposite of "static."</p>





                        <p>An object that is created using a class is said to be an <span class="newword">instance</span>
                            of that class.  We will sometimes say that the object <span class="newword">belongs</span> to the class.
                            The variables that the object contains
                            are called <span class="newword">instance variables</span>. The methods (that is, subroutines)
                            that the object contains are called <span class="newword">instance methods</span>.
                            For example, if the
                            <span class="code">PlayerData</span> class, as defined above, is used to create an object, then
                            that object is an instance of the <span class="code">PlayerData</span> class, and <span class="code">name</span>
                            and <span class="code">age</span> are instance variables in the object.</p>


                        <p>My examples here don't include any methods, but methods work similarly to variables.
                            Static methods are part of the class; non-static, or instance, methods become part of
                            objects created from the class.  It's not literally true that each object contains
                            its own copy of the actual compiled code for an instance method. But logically an instance
                            method is part of the object, and I will continue to say that the object "contains"
                            the instance method.</p>


                        <p>Note that you should distinguish between
                            the <b>source code</b> for the class, and the <b>class itself</b> (in memory).  The
                            source code determines both the class and the objects that are created from
                            that class.  The "static" definitions in the source code specify the things
                            that are part of the class itself (in the computer's memory), whereas the non-static definitions in the
                            source code specify things that will become part of every instance object
                            that is created from the class.   By the way, static member
                            variables and static member subroutines in a class are sometimes called
                            <span class="newword">class variables</span> and <span class="newword">class methods</span>,
                            since they belong to the class itself, rather than to instances
                            of that class.</p>


                        <p>As you can see, the static and the non-static portions of a class are very
                            different things and serve very different purposes. Many classes contain only
                            static members, or only non-static, and we will see only a few examples of
                            classes that contain a mixture of the two.  </p>


                       <h3 id="Fundamentals of Objects"><a class="header" href="#Fundamentals of Objects">Fundamentals of Objects</a></h3>


                        <p>So far, I've been talking mostly in generalities, and I haven't given you
                            much of an idea about what you have to put in a program if you want to work with objects.
                            Let's look at a specific example to see how it works. Consider this extremely
                            simplified version of a <span class="code">Student</span> class, which could be used to store
                            information about students taking a course:</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">public class Student {

   public String name;  // Student's name.
   public double test1, test2, test3;   // Grades on three tests.

   public double getAverage() {  // compute average test grade
      return (test1 + test2 + test3) / 3;
   }

}  // end of class Student</code></pre>


                        <p>None of the members of this class are declared to be <span class="code">static</span>, so the
                            class exists only for creating objects. This class definition says that any
                            object that is an instance of the <span class="classname">Student</span> class will include instance
                            variables named <span class="code">name</span>, <span class="code">test1</span>, <span class="code">test2</span>, and
                            <span class="code">test3</span>, and it will include an instance method named
                            <span class="code">getAverage()</span>. The names and test grades in different objects will generally
                            have different values. When called for a particular student, the method
                            <span class="code">getAverage()</span> will compute an average using <b>that
                                student's</b> test grades. Different students can have different averages.
                            (Again, this is what it means to say that an instance method belongs to an
                            individual object, not to the class.)</p>


                        <p>In Java, a class is a <b>type</b>, similar to the built-in types
                            such as <span class="ptype">int</span> and <span class="ptype">boolean</span>. So, a class name can be used to
                            specify the type of a variable in a declaration statement, or the type of a formal
                            parameter, or the return type of a function. For example, a program could
                            define a variable named <span class="code">std</span> of type <span class="code">Student</span> with the
                            statement</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">Student std;</code></pre>


                        <p>However, declaring a variable does <b>not</b> create an object!
                            This is an important point, which is related to this Very Important Fact:</p>


                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                <b>In Java, no variable can ever hold an object.<br>
                                    A variable can only hold a reference to an object.</b>
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>


                        <p>You should think of objects as floating around independently in the
                            computer's memory. In fact, there is a special portion of memory called the
                            <span class="newword">heap</span> where objects live. Instead of holding an
                            object itself, a variable holds the information necessary to find the object in
                            memory. This information is called a <span class="newword">reference</span> or
                            <span class="newword">pointer</span> to the object. In effect, a reference to
                            an object is the address of the memory location where the object is stored.
                            When you use a variable of object type, the computer uses the reference in the
                            variable to find the actual object.</p>


                        <p>In a program, objects are created using an operator called <span class="code">new</span>, which
                            creates an object and returns a reference to that object.  (In fact, the <span class="code">new</span> operator
                            calls a special subroutine called a "constructor" in the class.)
                            For example, assuming that <span class="code">std</span> is a variable of type <span class="code">Student</span>, declared as above,
                            the assignment statement</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">std = new Student();</code></pre>


                        <p>would create a new object which is an instance of the class
                            <span class="code">Student</span>, and it would store a reference to that object in the variable
                            <span class="code">std</span>. The value of the variable is a reference, or pointer, to the object.
                            The object itself is somewhere in the heap.
                            It is not quite true, then, to say that the object is the "value
                            of the variable <span class="code">std</span>" (though sometimes it is hard to avoid using this
                            terminology). It is certainly <b>not at all true</b> to say that the
                            object is "stored in the variable <span class="code">std</span>." The proper terminology is that
                            "the variable <span class="code">std</span> <span class="newword">refers to</span> or <span class="newword">points to</span>
                            the object," and I will try to stick to that terminology as much as possible.
                            If I ever say something like "std <b>is</b> an object," you should read it as
                            meaning "std is a variable that refers to an object."</p>


                        <p>So, suppose that the variable <span class="code">std</span> refers to an object that is an instance of
                            class <span class="code">Student</span>. That object contains instance variables <span class="code">name</span>,
                            <span class="code">test1</span>, <span class="code">test2</span>, and <span class="code">test3</span>. These instance variables
                            can be referred to as <span class="code">std.name</span>, <span class="code">std.test1</span>,
                            <span class="code">std.test2</span>, and <span class="code">std.test3</span>. This follows the usual naming
                            convention that when <span class="code">B</span> is part of <span class="code">A</span>, then the full name of
                            <span class="code">B</span> is <span class="code">A.B</span>. For example, a program might include the lines</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">System.out.println("Hello, "  +  std.name  +  ".  Your test grades are:");
System.out.println(std.test1);
System.out.println(std.test2);
System.out.println(std.test3);</code></pre>


                        <p>This would output the name and test grades from the object to which
                            <span class="code">std</span> refers. Similarly, <span class="code">std</span> can be used to call the
                            <span class="code">getAverage()</span> instance method in the object by saying
                            <span class="code">std.getAverage()</span>. To print out the student's average, you could
                            say:</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">System.out.println( "Your average is "  +  std.getAverage() );</code></pre>


                        <p>More generally, you could use <span class="code">std.name</span> any place where a variable
                            of type <span class="classname">String</span> is legal. You can use it in expressions. You can assign
                            a value to it. You can even use it to call subroutines from the <span class="classname">String</span>
                            class. For example, <span class="code">std.name.length()</span> is the number of characters in
                            the student's name.</p>


                        <p>It is possible for a variable like <span class="code">std</span>, whose type is given by a
                            class, to refer to no object at all. We say in this case that <span class="code">std</span>
                            holds a <span class="newword">null pointer</span> or <span class="newword">null reference</span>. The null pointer is
                            written in Java as: <span class="code">null</span>. You can store a null reference in the
                            variable <span class="code">std</span> by saying</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">std = null;</code></pre>


                        <p>
                            <span class="code">null</span> is an actual value that is stored in the variable, not a pointer
                            to something else.  It is <b>not</b> correct to say that the variable "points to null";
                            in fact, the variable <b>is</b> null.  For example,
                            you can test whether the value of <span class="code">std</span> is null by testing</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">if (std == null) . . .</code></pre>


                        <p>If the value of a variable is <span class="code">null</span>, then it is, of course, illegal
                            to refer to instance variables or instance methods through that variable&mdash;since
                            there <b>is no object</b>, and hence no instance variables to refer to!  For
                            example, if the value of the variable <span class="code">std</span> is <span class="code">null</span>, then it
                            would be illegal to refer to <span class="code">std.test1</span>. If your program attempts to
                            use a null pointer illegally in this way, the result is an error called a
                            <span class="newword">null pointer exception</span>.  When this happens while the program
                            is running, an exception of type <span class="classname">NullPointerException</span>
                            is thrown.
                        </p>


                        <p>Let's look at a sequence of statements that work with objects:</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">Student std, std1,       // Declare four variables of
          std2, std3;    //   type Student.

std = new Student();     // Create a new object belonging
                         //   to the class Student, and
                         //   store a reference to that
                         //   object in the variable std.

std1 = new Student();    // Create a second Student object
                         //   and store a reference to
                         //   it in the variable std1.

std2 = std1;             // Copy the reference value in std1
                         //   into the variable std2.

std3 = null;             // Store a null reference in the
                         //   variable std3.

std.name = "John Smith";  // Set values of some instance variables.
std1.name = "Mary Jones";

     // (Other instance variables have default
     //    initial values of zero.)</code></pre>


                        <p>After the computer executes these statements, the situation in the
                            computer's memory looks like this:</p>


                        <p align="center">
                            <img src="./images/objects-in-heap.png" width="537" height="425" alt="Objects and variables created by the above code"></p>



                        <p>In this picture, when a variable
                            contains a reference to an object, the value of that variable is shown as an
                            arrow pointing to the object.   Note, by the way, that the <span class="classname">Strings</span>
                            are objects!  The variable <span class="code">std3</span>, with a value of
                            <span class="code">null</span>, doesn't point anywhere. The arrows from <span class="code">std1</span> and
                            <span class="code">std2</span> both point to the same object. This illustrates a Very Important
                            Point:</p>


                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                <b>When one object variable is assigned<br>
                                    to another, only a reference is copied.<br>
                                    The object referred to is not copied.</b>
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>


                        <p>When the assignment "<span class="code">std2 = std1</span>;" was executed, no new object was
                            created. Instead, <span class="code">std2</span> was set to refer to the very same object that
                            <span class="code">std1</span> refers to.   This is to be expected, since the assignment
                            statement just copies the value that is stored in <span class="code">std1</span> into
                            <span class="code">std2</span>, and that value is a pointer, not an object.
                            But this has some consequences that might be surprising.
                            For example, <span class="code">std1.name</span> and <span class="code">std2.name</span> are two different names for the
                            same variable, namely the instance variable in the object that both
                            <span class="code">std1</span> and <span class="code">std2</span> refer to. After the string <span class="code">"Mary
Jones"</span> is assigned to the variable <span class="code"><b>std1</b>.name</span>, it is also
                            true that the value of <span class="code"><b>std2</b>.name</span> is <span class="code">"Mary Jones"</span>.
                            There is a potential for a lot of confusion here, but you can help protect
                            yourself from it if you keep telling yourself, "The object is not in the
                            variable. The variable just holds a pointer to the object."</p>


                        <p>You can test objects for equality and inequality using the operators <span class="code">==</span> and
                            <span class="code">!=</span>, but here again, the semantics are different from what you are used to. When
                            you make a test "<span class="code">if&nbsp;(std1&nbsp;==&nbsp;std2)</span>", you are testing whether the
                            values stored in <span class="code">std1</span> and <span class="code">std2</span> are the same. But the values that you are comparing
                            are references to objects; they are not objects. So, you are testing whether
                            <span class="code">std1</span> and <span class="code">std2</span> refer to the same object. This is fine, if it's what you want to do.
                            But sometimes, what you want to check is whether the instance variables in the
                            objects have the same values. To do that, you would need to ask whether
                            "<span class="code">std1.test1 == std2.test1 &amp;&amp; std1.test2 == std2.test2 &amp;&amp;
std1.test3 == std2.test3 &amp;&amp; std1.name.equals(std2.name)</span>".</p>


                        <p>I've remarked previously that <span class="classname">Strings</span> are objects, and I've shown
                            the strings <span class="code">"Mary Jones"</span> and <span class="code">"John Smith"</span> as objects in the
                            above illustration.  (Strings are special objects, treated by Java in a special way, and I
                            haven't attempted to show the actual internal structure of the <span class="classname">String</span> objects.)
                            Since strings are objects, a variable of type <span class="classname">String</span> can only hold a
                            reference to a string, not the string itself.  This
                            explains why using the <span class="code">==</span> operator to test strings for equality is not
                            a good idea. Suppose that <span class="code">greeting</span> is a variable of type
                            <span class="classname">String</span>, and that it refers to the string <span class="code">"Hello"</span>. Then
                            would the test <span class="code">greeting&nbsp;==&nbsp;"Hello"</span> be true? Well, maybe, maybe not.
                            The variable <span class="code">greeting</span> and the <span class="classname">String</span> literal <span class="code">"Hello"</span>
                            each refer to a string that contains the characters H-e-l-l-o. But the strings
                            could still be different objects, that just happen to contain the same
                            characters; in that case, <span class="code">greeting&nbsp;==&nbsp;"Hello"</span> would be false.
                            The function <span class="code">greeting.equals("Hello")</span> tests whether
                            <span class="code">greeting</span> and <span class="code">"Hello"</span> contain the same characters, which is
                            almost certainly the question you want to ask. The expression
                            <span class="code">greeting&nbsp;==&nbsp;"Hello"</span> tests whether <span class="code">greeting</span>
                            and <span class="code">"Hello"</span> contain the same characters <b>stored in the same memory location</b>.
                            (Of course, a <span class="classname">String</span> variable such as <span class="code">greeting</span>
                            can also contain the special value <span class="code">null</span>, and it <b>would</b> make
                            sense to use the <span class="code">==</span> operator to test whether "<span class="code">greeting&nbsp;==&nbsp;null</span>".)
                        </p>





                        <p>The fact that variables hold references to objects, not objects themselves,
                            has a couple of other consequences that you should be aware of. They follow
                            logically, if you just keep in mind the basic fact that the object is not
                            stored in the variable. The object is somewhere else; the variable points to it.</p>


                        <p>Suppose that a variable that refers to an object is declared to be
                            <span class="code">final</span>. This means that the value stored in the variable can never be
                            changed, once the variable has been initialized. The value stored in the
                            variable is a reference to the object. So the variable will continue to refer
                            to the same object as long as the variable exists. However, this does not
                            prevent the data <b>in the object</b> from changing. The variable is
                            <span class="code">final</span>, not the object. It's perfectly legal to say</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">final Student stu = new Student();

stu.name = "John Doe";  // Change data in the object;
                        // The value stored in stu is not changed!
                        // It still refers to the same object.</code></pre>


                        <p>Next, suppose that <span class="code">obj</span> is a variable that refers to an object.
                            Let's consider what happens when <span class="code">obj</span> is passed as an actual parameter
                            to a subroutine. The value of <span class="code">obj</span> is assigned to a formal parameter in
                            the subroutine, and the subroutine is executed. The subroutine has no power to
                            change the value stored in the variable, <span class="code">obj</span>. It only has a copy of
                            that value. However, the value is a reference to an object. Since the
                            subroutine has a reference to the object, it can change the data stored <b>in</b> the
                            object. After the subroutine ends, <span class="code">obj</span> still points to the same
                            object, but the data stored <b>in the object</b> might have changed.
                            Suppose <span class="code">x</span> is a variable of type <span class="ptype">int</span> and <span class="code">stu</span> is a
                            variable of type <span class="code">Student</span>. Compare:</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">void dontChange(int z) {                void change(Student s) {
    z = 42;                                  s.name = "Fred";
}                                       }

<span class="newcode">The lines:                              The lines:</span>

   x = 17;                                 stu.name = "Jane";
   dontChange(x);                          change(stu);
   System.out.println(x);                  System.out.println(stu.name);

<span class="newcode">output the value 17.                    output the value "Fred".

The value of x is <b>not</b>                   The value of stu is not
changed by the subroutine,              changed, but stu.name <b>is</b> changed.
which is equivalent to                  This is equivalent to</span>

   z = x;                                  s = stu;
   z = 42;                                 s.name = "Fred";</code></pre>



                       <h3 id="Getters and Setters"><a class="header" href="#Getters and Setters">Getters and Setters</a></h3>

                        <p>When writing new classes, it's a good idea to pay attention to the issue
                            of access control.  Recall that making a member of a class <span class="code">public</span>
                            makes it accessible from anywhere, including from other classes.  On the
                            other hand, a <span class="code">private</span> member can only be used in the class
                            where it is defined.</p>


                        <p>In the opinion of many programmers, almost all member variables should
                            be declared <span class="code">private</span>.  This gives you complete control over what
                            can be done with the variable.  Even if the variable itself is private,
                            you can allow other classes to find out what its value is by providing
                            a <span class="code">public</span> <span class="newword">accessor method</span> that returns the
                            value of the variable.  For example, if your class contains a <span class="code">private</span>
                            member variable, <span class="code">title</span>, of type <span class="classname">String</span>, you
                            can provide a method</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">public String getTitle() {
    return title;
}</code></pre>



                        <p>that returns the value of <span class="code">title</span>.  By convention, the name of
                            an accessor method for a variable is obtained by capitalizing the name of variable and
                            adding "get" in front of the name.  So, for the variable <span class="code">title</span>, we get
                            an accessor method named "get" <span class="code">+</span> "Title", or <span class="code">getTitle()</span>.
                            Because of this naming convention, accessor methods are more often referred to
                            as <span class="newword">getter methods</span>.  A getter method provides "read access" to
                            a variable.  (Sometimes for <span class="ptype">boolean</span> variables, "is" is used in place
                            of "get".  For example, a getter for a <span class="ptype">boolean</span> member variable named
                            <span class="code">done</span> might be called <span class="code">isDone()</span>.)</p>


                        <p>You might also want to allow "write access" to a <span class="code">private</span> variable.
                            That is, you might want to make it possible for other classes to specify a new value
                            for the variable.  This is done with a <span class="newword">setter method</span>.  (If you don't
                            like simple, Anglo-Saxon words, you can use the fancier term <span class="newword">mutator method</span>.)
                            The name of a setter method should consist of "set" followed by a capitalized copy of
                            the variable's name, and it should have a parameter with the same type as the
                            variable.  A setter method for the variable <span class="code">title</span> could be written</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">public void setTitle( String newTitle ) {
   title = newTitle;
}</code></pre>


                        <p>It is actually very common to provide both a getter and a setter method for
                            a private member variable.  Since this allows other classes both to see and to
                            change the value of the variable, you might wonder why not just make the
                            variable <span class="code">public</span>?  The reason is that getters and setters are not
                            restricted to simply reading and writing the variable's value.  In fact,
                            they can take any action at all.  For example, a getter method might keep
                            track of the number of times that the variable has been accessed:</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">public String getTitle() {
    titleAccessCount++;  // Increment member variable titleAccessCount.
    return title;
}</code></pre>


                        <p>and a setter method might check that the value that is being
                            assigned to the variable is legal:</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">public void setTitle( String newTitle ) {
   if ( newTitle == null )   // Don't allow null strings as titles!
      title = "(Untitled)";  // Use an appropriate default value instead.
   else
      title = newTitle;
}</code></pre>


                        <p>Even if you can't think of any extra chores to do in a getter or setter
                            method, you might change your mind in the future when you redesign and
                            improve your class.  If you've used a getter and setter from the beginning,
                            you can make the modification to your class without affecting any of the
                            classes that use your class.  The <span class="code">private</span> member variable
                            is not part of the public interface of your class; only the <span class="code">public</span>
                            getter and setter methods are, and you are free to change their implementations
                            without changing the public interface of your class.
                            If you <b>haven't</b> used get and set from
                            the beginning, you'll have to contact everyone who uses your class and
                            tell them, "Sorry people, you'll have to track down every use that you've
                            made of this variable and change your code to use my new get and set
                            methods instead."</p>


                        <p>A couple of final notes:  Some advanced aspects of Java rely on the
                            naming convention for getter and setter methods, so it's a good idea to
                            follow the convention rigorously.  And though I've been talking about using
                            getter and setter methods for a variable, you can define get and set
                            methods even if there is no variable.  A getter and/or setter method defines
                            a <span class="newword">property</span> of the class, that might or might not correspond
                            to a variable.  For example, if a class includes a <span class="code">public</span> <span class="code">void</span>
                            instance method with signature <span class="code">setValue(double)</span>, then the class
                            has a "property" named <span class="code">value</span> of type <span class="ptype">double</span>, and
                            it has this property whether or not the class has a member variable
                            named <span class="code">value</span>.
                        </p>


                       <h3 id="Arrays and Objects"><a class="header" href="#Arrays and Objects">Arrays and Objects</a></h3>


                        <p>As I noted in <a href="ch03-08-Arrays.html">Subsection&nbsp;3.8.1</a>, arrays are objects.  Like <span class="classname">Strings</span>
                            they are special objects, with their own unique syntax.  An array type such as
                            <span class="atype">int[]</span> or <span class="atype">String[]</span> is actually a class, and arrays
                            are created using a special version of the <span class="code">new</span> operator.
                            As in the case for other object variables,  an array variable can never
                            hold an actual array&mdash;only a reference to an array object.  The array object
                            itself exists in the heap.  It is possible for an array variable to hold the value
                            <span class="code">null</span>, which means there is no actual array.</p>


                        <p>For example, suppose that <span class="code">list</span> is a variable of type <span class="atype">int[]</span>.
                            If the value of <span class="code">list</span> is <span class="code">null</span>, then any attempt to access
                            <span class="code">list.length</span> or an array element <span class="code">list[i]</span> would be an error
                            and would cause an exception of type <span class="classname">NullPointerException</span>.  If
                            <span class="code">newlist</span> is another variable of type <span class="atype">int[]</span>, then the
                            assignment statement</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">newlist = list;</code></pre>


                        <p>only copies the reference value in <span class="code">list</span> into <span class="code">newlist</span>.
                            If <span class="code">list</span> is <span class="code">null</span>, the result is that <span class="code">newlist</span> will also be <span class="code">null</span>.
                            If <span class="code">list</span> points to an array, the assignment statement does <b>not</b> make a copy of the
                            array.  It just sets <span class="code">newlist</span> to refer to the same array as <span class="code">list</span>.  For
                            example, the output of the following code segment</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">list = new int[3];
list[1] = 17;
newlist = list; // newlist points to the same array as list!
newlist[1] = 42;
System.out.println( list[1] );</code></pre>


                        <p>would be 42, not 17, since <span class="code">list[1]</span> and <span class="code">newlist[1]</span> are just different names
                            for the same element in the array.  All this is very natural, once you understand that
                            arrays are objects and array variables hold pointers to arrays.</p>


                        <p>This fact also comes into play when an array is passed as a parameter to a subroutine.
                            The value that is copied into the subroutine is a pointer to the array.  The array is
                            not copied.  Since the subroutine has a reference to the original array, any changes that
                            it makes to elements of the array are being made to the original and will persist after
                            the subroutine returns.</p>





                        <p>Arrays are objects.  They can also hold objects.
                            The base type of an array can be a class.  We have already seen this when we used
                            arrays of type <span class="atype">String[]</span>, but any class can be used as the base type.
                            For example, suppose <span class="classname">Student</span> is the class defined earlier in
                            this section.  Then we can have arrays of type <span class="atype">Student[]</span>.  For an array
                            of type <span class="atype">Student[]</span>, each element of the array is a variable of type
                            <span class="classname">Student</span>.  To store information about 30 students,
                            we could use an array:</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">Student[] classlist;  // Declare a variable of type Student[].
classlist = new Student[30];  // The variable now points to an array.</code></pre>


                        <p>The array has 30 elements, <span class="code">classlist[0]</span>, <span class="code">classlist[1]</span>,
                            ... <span class="code">classlist[29]</span>.  When the array is created, it is filled with the
                            default initial value, which for an object type is <span class="code">null</span>.  So, although
                            we have 30 array elements of type <span class="classname">Student</span>, we don't yet have
                            any actual <span class="classname">Student</span> objects!  All we have is 30 nulls.
                            If we want student objects, we have to create them:</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">Student[] classlist;
classlist = new Student[30];
for ( int i = 0; i &lt; 30; i++ ) {
    classlist[i] = new Student();
}</code></pre>


                        <p>Once we have done this, each <span class="code">classlist[i]</span> points to an object of type
                            <span class="classname">Student</span>.  If we want to talk about the name of student number 3,
                            we can use <span class="code">classlist[3].name</span>.  The average for student number <span class="code">i</span>
                            can be computed by calling <span class="code">classlist[i].getAverage()</span>.  You can do anything
                            with <span class="code">classlist[i]</span> that you could do with any other variable of type
                            <span class="classname">Student</span>.</p>
