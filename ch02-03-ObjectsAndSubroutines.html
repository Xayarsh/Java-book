                        <p>
                            The previous section introduced the eight primitive
                            data types and the type <em>String</em>. There is a fundamental difference
                            between the primitive types and <em>String</em>: Values of type
                            <em>String</em> are objects. While we will not study objects in detail until
                            <a href="ch05-00-ObjectsClasses.html">Chapter&nbsp;5</a>, it will be useful for you to know a
                            little about them and about a closely related topic: classes. This is not just
                            because strings are useful but because objects and classes are essential to
                            understanding another important programming concept, subroutines.</p>


                        <h3 id="built-in-subfunc"><a class="header" href="#built-in-subfunc">Built-in Subroutines and Functions</a></h3>


                        <p>Recall that a subroutine is a set of program instructions that have been
                            chunked together and given a name.  A subroutine is designed to perform some
                            task.  To get that task performed in a program, you can "call" the subroutine
                            using a subroutine call statement.  In <a href="ch04-00-Subroutines.html">Chapter&nbsp;4</a>,
                            you'll learn how to write your own subroutines, but you can get a lot done in a
                            program just by calling subroutines that have already been written for you. In
                            Java, every subroutine is contained either in a class or in an object. Some classes
                            that are standard parts of the Java language contain predefined subroutines
                            that you can use. A value of type <em>String</em>, which is an object, contains
                            subroutines that you can use to manipulate that string.  These subroutines are
                            "built into" the Java language.  You can call all these
                            subroutines without understanding how they were written or how they work.
                            Indeed, that's the whole point of subroutines: A subroutine is a "black box"
                            which can be used without knowing what goes on inside.</p>


                        <p>Let's first consider subroutines that are part of a class.  One of the
                            purposes of a class is to group together some variables and subroutines,
                            which are contained in that class.
                            These variables and subroutines are called <code>static members</code>
                            of the class. You've seen one example: In a class that defines a
                            program, the <span class="code">main()</span> routine is a static member of the class. The parts
                            of a class definition that define static members are marked with the reserved
                            word "<span class="code">static</span>", such as the word "static" in <span class="code">public static void main...</span>

                        </p>


                        <p>When a class contains a static variable or subroutine, the name of the class is part
                            of the full name of the variable or subroutine.  For example,
                            the standard class named <em>System</em> contains a subroutine named
                            <span class="code">exit</span>.  To use that subroutine in your program, you must refer to it as
                            <span class="code">System.exit</span>.  This full name consists of the name of the class that contains
                            the subroutine, followed by a period, followed by the name of the subroutine.
                            This subroutine requires an integer as its parameter, so you would actually use it with
                            a subroutine call statement such as</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">System.exit(0);</code></pre>


                        <p>Calling <span class="code">System.exit</span> will terminate the program and shut down the
                            Java Virtual Machine. You
                            could use it if you had some reason to terminate the program before the end of
                            the <span class="code">main</span> routine. (The parameter
                            tells the computer why the program was terminated.  A parameter value of 0
                            indicates that the program ended normally. Any other value indicates that
                            the program was terminated because an error was detected, so you could
                            call <span class="code">System.exit(1)</span> to indicate that the program is ending because of
                            an error.  The parameter is sent back to the operating system; in practice,
                            the value is usually ignored by the operating system.)</p>


                        <p>
                            <em>System</em> is just one of many standard classes that come
                            with Java.  Another useful class is called <em>Math</em>.
                            This class gives us an example of a class that contains
                            static variables: It includes the variables <span class="code">Math.PI</span> and <span class="code">Math.E</span>
                            whose values are the mathematical constants π and&nbsp;e.
                            <em>Math</em> also contains a large number of mathematical "functions."
                            Now, any subroutine performs some specific task, but for some subroutines, the
                            task is to compute or retrieve some data value. Subroutines of this type are
                            called <code>functions</code>. We say that a function
                            <code>returns</code> a value. Generally, the returned value is meant to be
                            used somehow in the program that calls the function.
                        </p>


                        <p>You are familiar with the mathematical function that computes the square
                            root of a number. The corresponding function in Java is called <span class="code">Math.sqrt</span>.
                            This function is a static member subroutine in the class named <em>Math</em>.
                            If <span class="code">x</span> is any numerical value, then <span class="code">Math.sqrt(x)</span> computes and
                            returns the square root of that value. Since <span class="code">Math.sqrt(x)</span> represents a
                            value, it doesn't make sense to put it on a line by itself in a subroutine call
                            statement such as</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">Math.sqrt(x);   // <b>This doesn't make sense!</b>
</code></pre>


                        <p>What, after all, would the computer do with the value computed by the
                            function in this case? You have to tell the computer to do something with the
                            value. You might tell the computer to display it:</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">System.out.print( Math.sqrt(x) );  // Display the square root of x.</code></pre>


                        <p>or you might use an assignment statement to tell the computer to store that
                            value in a variable:</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">lengthOfSide = Math.sqrt(x);</code></pre>


                        <p>The function call <span class="code">Math.sqrt(x)</span> represents a value of type
                            <span class="ptype">double</span>, and it can be used anyplace where a numeric literal of type
                            double could be used.  The <span class="code">x</span> in this formula represents the
                            parameter to the subroutine; it could be a variable
                            named "x", or it could be replaced by any expression that represents a numerical
                            value.  For example, <span class="code">Math.sqrt(2)</span> computes the square root of 2,
                            and <span class="code">Math.sqrt(a*a+b*b)</span> would be legal as long as <span class="code">a</span>
                            and <span class="code">b</span> are numeric variables.</p>


                        <p>The <em>Math</em> class contains many static member functions. Here is a
                            list of some of the more important of them:</p>


                        <ul>

                            <li>
                                <span class="code">Math.abs(x)</span>, which computes the absolute value of <span class="code">x</span>.</li>


                            <li>The usual trigonometric functions, <span class="code">Math.sin(x)</span>,
                                <span class="code">Math.cos(x)</span>, and <span class="code">Math.tan(x)</span>. (For all the trigonometric
                                functions, angles are measured in radians, not degrees.)</li>


                            <li>The inverse trigonometric functions arcsin, arccos, and arctan, which are
                                written as: <span class="code">Math.asin(x)</span>, <span class="code">Math.acos(x)</span>, and
                                <span class="code">Math.atan(x)</span>.  The return value is expressed in radians, not degrees.</li>


                            <li>The exponential function <span class="code">Math.exp(x)</span> for computing the number e
                                raised to the power <span class="code">x</span>, and the natural logarithm function
                                <span class="code">Math.log(x)</span> for computing the logarithm of <span class="code">x</span> in the base
                                e.</li>


                            <li>
                                <span class="code">Math.pow(x,y)</span> for computing <span class="code">x</span> raised to the power
                                <span class="code">y</span>.</li>


                            <li>
                                <span class="code">Math.floor(x)</span>, which rounds <span class="code">x</span> down to the nearest integer
                                value that is less than or equal to <span class="code">x</span>.   Even though the return value is
                                mathematically an integer, it is returned as a value of type <span class="ptype">double</span>, rather than
                                of type <span class="ptype">int</span> as you might expect.   For example,
                                <span class="code">Math.floor(3.76)</span> is 3.0, and <span class="code">Math.floor(-4.2)</span> is&nbsp;-5.0.
                                The function <span class="code">Math.round(x)</span> returns
                                the integer that is closest to <span class="code">x</span>, and <span class="code">Math.ceil(x)</span> rounds <span class="code">x</span>
                                up to an integer.  ("Ceil" is short for "ceiling", the opposite of "floor.")</li>


                            <li>
                                <span class="code">Math.random()</span>, which returns a randomly chosen <span class="ptype">double</span> in
                                the range <span class="code">0.0 &lt;= Math.random() &lt; 1.0</span>. (The computer actually
                                calculates so-called "pseudorandom" numbers, which are not truly random but are effectively
                                random enough for most purposes.)  We will find a lot of uses for <span class="code">Math.random</span>
                                in future examples.</li>

                        </ul>


                        <p>For these functions, the type of the parameter&mdash;the <span class="code">x</span> or <span class="code">y</span> inside
                            the parentheses&mdash;can be any value of any numeric type. For most of the functions, the value
                            returned by the function is of type <span class="ptype">double</span> no matter what the type of
                            the parameter. However, for <span class="code">Math.abs(x)</span>, the value returned will be
                            the same type as <span class="code">x</span>; if <span class="code">x</span> is of type <span class="ptype">int</span>, then so is
                            <span class="code">Math.abs(x)</span>. So, for example, while <span class="code">Math.sqrt(9)</span> is the
                            <span class="ptype">double</span> value 3.0, <span class="code">Math.abs(9)</span> is the <span class="ptype">int</span> value&nbsp;9.</p>


                        <p>Note that <span class="code">Math.random()</span> does not have any parameter. You still need
                            the parentheses, even though there's nothing between them. The parentheses let
                            the computer know that this is a subroutine rather than a variable. Another
                            example of a subroutine that has no parameters is the function
                            <span class="code">System.currentTimeMillis()</span>, from the <em>System</em> class. When this
                            function is executed, it retrieves the current time, expressed as the number of
                            milliseconds that have passed since a standardized base time (the start of the
                            year 1970, if you care). One millisecond is one-thousandth
                            of a second. The return value of <span class="code">System.currentTimeMillis()</span> is of type
                            <span class="ptype">long</span> (a 64-bit integer). This function can be used to measure the time that it takes the
                            computer to perform a task. Just record the time at which the task is begun and
                            the time at which it is finished and take the difference.  For more accurate timing,
                            you can use <span class="code">System.nanoTime()</span> instead. <span class="code">System.nanoTime()</span>
                            returns the number of nanoseconds since some arbitrary starting time, where one
                            nanosecond is one-billionth of a second.  However, you should not expect the
                            time to be truly accurate to the nanosecond.</p>

                        <h3 id="cls-ob"><a class="header" href="#cls-ob">Classes and Objects</a></h3>

                        <p>Classes can be containers for static variables and subroutines.  However classes also have
                            another purpose.  They are used to describe objects.  In
                            this role, the class is a <b>type</b>, in the same way that <span class="ptype">int</span>
                            and <span class="ptype">double</span> are types.  That is, the class name can be used to declare
                            variables. Such variables can only hold one type of value. The values in this case are
                            <code>objects</code>.  An object is a collection of variables and subroutines.
                            Every object has an associated class that tells what "type" of object it is.
                            The class of an object specifies what subroutines and variables that object contains.
                            All objects defined by the same class are similar in that they contain similar collections
                            of variables and subroutines.  For example, an object might represent a point in the plane,
                            and it might contain variables named <span class="code">x</span> and <span class="code">y</span> to represent the
                            coordinates of that point.  Every point object would have an <span class="code">x</span> and a <span class="code">y</span>,
                            but different points would have different values for these variables.  A class, named
                            <em>Point</em> for example, could exist to define the common structure of
                            all point objects, and all such objects would then be values of type <em>Point</em>.</p>


                        <p>As another example, let's look again at <span class="code">System.out.println</span>.  <em>System</em>
                            is a class, and <span class="code">out</span> is a static variable within that class.  However, the value of
                            <span class="code">System.out</span> is an <b>object</b>, and <span class="code">System.out.println</span> is actually
                            the full name of a subroutine that is contained in the object <span class="code">System.out</span>.  You don't need to
                            understand it at this point, but  the object referred to by <span class="code">System.out</span>
                            is an object of the class <em>PrintStream</em>. <em>PrintStream</em> is another
                            class that is a standard part of Java. <b>Any</b> object of type
                            <em>PrintStream</em> is a destination to which information can be printed;
                            <b>any</b> object of type <em>PrintStream</em> has a <span class="code">println</span>
                            subroutine that can be used to send information to that destination. The object
                            <span class="code">System.out</span> is just one possible destination, and
                            <span class="code">System.out.println</span> is a subroutine that sends information to that particular
                            destination. Other objects of type <em>PrintStream</em> might send information
                            to other destinations such as files or across a network to other computers.
                            This is object-oriented programming: Many different things which have something
                            in common&mdash;they can all be used as destinations for output&mdash;can all be
                            used in the same way&mdash;through a <span class="code">println</span> subroutine. The
                            <em>PrintStream</em> class expresses the commonalities among all these
                            objects.</p>


                        <p>The dual role of classes&mdash;to contain static variables and subroutines and to
                            describe objects that can also contain variables and subroutines&mdash;can
                            be confusing, and in practice most classes are designed to
                            perform primarily or exclusively in only one of the two possible roles.  Fortunately,
                            you will not need to worry too much about it until we start working with objects in a
                            more serious way, in <a href="ch05-00-ObjectsClasses.html">Chapter&nbsp;5</a>.</p>


                        <p>By the way, since class names and variable names are used in similar ways, it might be
                            hard to tell which is which. Remember that all the built-in, predefined names in Java follow
                            the rule that class names begin with an upper case letter while variable names
                            begin with a lower case letter. While this is not a formal syntax rule, I strongly
                            recommend that you follow it in your own programming. Subroutine names should
                            also begin with lower case letters. There is no possibility of confusing a
                            variable with a subroutine, since a subroutine name in a program is always
                            followed by a left parenthesis.</p>


                        <p>As one final general note, you should be aware that subroutines in Java
                            are often referred to as <code>methods</code>.  Generally, the
                            term "method" means a subroutine that is contained in a class or in an object.
                            Since this is true of every subroutine in Java, every subroutine in Java is
                            a method. The same is not true for other programming languages, and
                            for the time being, I will prefer to use the more general term, "subroutine."
                            However, I should note that some people prefer to use the term "method"
                            from the beginning.</p>


                        <h3 id="op-str"><a class="header" href="#op-str">Operations on Strings</a></h3>

                        <p>
                            <em>String</em> is a class, and a value of type <em>String</em> is an object.
                            That object contains data, namely the sequence of characters that make up the string. It also contains
                            subroutines. All of these subroutines are in fact functions. For example, every string object contains
                            a function named <span class="code">length</span>  that computes the number of characters in that string. Suppose
                            that <span class="code">advice</span> is a variable that refers to a <em>String</em>. For example,
                            <span class="code">advice</span> might have been declared and assigned a value as follows:</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">String advice;
advice = "Seize the day!";</code></pre>


                        <p>Then <span class="code">advice.length()</span> is a function call that returns the number of
                            characters in the string "Seize the day!".  In this case, the return value would be 14.
                            In general, for any variable <span class="code">str</span> of type  <em>String</em>,
                            the value of <span class="code">str.length()</span> is an
                            <span class="ptype">int</span> equal to the number of characters in the string.
                            Note that this function has no parameter; the particular string whose length
                            is being computed is the value of <span class="code">str</span>.  The <span class="code">length</span> subroutine is defined by
                            the class <em>String</em>, and it can be used with any value of type
                            <em>String</em>. It can even be used with <em>String</em> literals, which are,
                            after all, just constant values of type <em>String</em>. For example, you could
                            have a program count the characters in "Hello World" for you by saying</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">System.out.print("The number of characters in ");
System.out.print("the string \"Hello World\" is ");
System.out.println( "Hello World".length() );</code></pre>


                        <p>The <em>String</em> class defines a lot of functions. Here are some that you
                            might find useful. Assume that <span class="code">s1</span> and <span class="code">s2</span> are variables of
                            type <em>String</em>:</p>


                        <ul>

                            <li>
                                <span class="code">s1.equals(s2)</span> is a function that returns a <span class="ptype">boolean</span> value.
                                It returns <span class="code">true</span> if <span class="code">s1</span> consists of exactly the same sequence
                                of characters as <span class="code">s2</span>, and returns <span class="code">false</span> otherwise.</li>


                            <li>
                                <span class="code">s1.equalsIgnoreCase(s2)</span> is another boolean-valued function that
                                checks whether <span class="code">s1</span> is the same string as <span class="code">s2</span>, but this function
                                considers upper and lower case letters to be equivalent. Thus, if <span class="code">s1</span>
                                is "cat", then <span class="code">s1.equals("Cat")</span> is <span class="code">false</span>, while
                                <span class="code">s1.equalsIgnoreCase("Cat")</span> is <span class="code">true</span>.</li>


                            <li>
                                <span class="code">s1.length()</span>, as mentioned above, is an integer-valued function
                                that gives the number of characters in <span class="code">s1</span>.</li>


                            <li>
                                <span class="code">s1.charAt(N)</span>, where <span class="code">N</span> is an integer, returns a value of
                                type <span class="ptype">char</span>. It returns the Nth character in the string.
                                Positions are numbered starting with 0, so <span class="code">s1.charAt(0)</span> is actually
                                the first character, <span class="code">s1.charAt(1)</span> is the second, and so on. The final
                                position is <span class="code">s1.length()&nbsp;-&nbsp;1</span>. For example, the value of
                                <span class="code">"cat".charAt(1)</span> is 'a'. An error occurs if the value of the parameter
                                is less than zero or is greater than or equal to <span class="code">s1.length()</span>.</li>


                            <li>
                                <span class="code">s1.substring(N,M)</span>, where <span class="code">N</span> and <span class="code">M</span> are integers,
                                returns a value of type <em>String</em>. The returned value consists of the
                                characters of <span class="code">s1</span> in positions <span class="code">N</span>, <span class="code">N+1</span>,...,
                                <span class="code">M-1</span>. Remember that character positions are numbered starting from zero.
                                Note that the character in position <span class="code">M</span> is not included.
                                The returned value is called a substring of <span class="code">s1</span>.
                                The subroutine <span class="code">s1.substring(N)</span>, with just one parameter, returns the substring of <span class="code">s1</span>
                                consisting of characters starting at position <span class="code">N</span> up until the end of
                                the string.</li>


                            <li>
                                <span class="code">s1.indexOf(s2)</span> returns an integer. If <span class="code">s2</span> occurs as a
                                substring of <span class="code">s1</span>, then the returned value is the starting position of
                                that substring. Otherwise, the returned value is -1. You can also use
                                <span class="code">s1.indexOf(ch)</span> to search for a <span class="ptype">char</span>, <span class="code">ch</span>, in
                                <span class="code">s1</span>. To find the first occurrence of <span class="code">x</span> at or after position
                                <span class="code">N</span>, you can use <span class="code">s1.indexOf(x,N)</span>.  To find the last occurrence of
                                <span class="code">x</span> in <span class="code">s1</span>, use <span class="code">s1.lastIndexOf(x)</span>.</li>


                            <li>
                                <span class="code">s1.compareTo(s2)</span> is an integer-valued function that compares the
                                two strings. If the strings are equal, the value returned is zero. If
                                <span class="code">s1</span> is less than <span class="code">s2</span>, the value returned is a number less than
                                zero, and if <span class="code">s1</span> is greater than <span class="code">s2</span>, the value returned is
                                some number greater than zero. There is also a function <span class="code">s1.compareToIgnoreCase(s2)</span>.
                                (If both of the strings consist entirely of
                                lower case letters, or if they consist entirely of upper case letters,
                                then "less than" and "greater than" refer to alphabetical
                                order. Otherwise, the ordering is more complicated; it compares individual characters using
                                their Unicode code numbers.)</li>


                            <li>
                                <span class="code">s1.toUpperCase()</span> is a <em>String</em>-valued function that returns
                                a new string that is equal to <span class="code">s1</span>, except that any lower case letters
                                in <span class="code">s1</span> have been converted to upper case. For example,
                                <span class="code">"Cat".toUpperCase()</span> is the string <span class="code">"CAT"</span>. There is also a function
                                <span class="code">s1.toLowerCase()</span>.</li>


                            <li>
                                <span class="code">s1.trim()</span> is a <em>String</em>-valued function that returns a new
                                string that is equal to <span class="code">s1</span> except that any non-printing characters
                                such as spaces and tabs have been trimmed from the beginning and from the end
                                of the string. Thus, if <span class="code">s1</span> has the value <span class="code">"fred&nbsp;&nbsp;"</span>, then
                                <span class="code">s1.trim()</span> is the string <span class="code">"fred"</span>, with the spaces at the end removed.</li>

                        </ul>


                        <p>For the functions <span class="code">s1.toUpperCase()</span>, <span class="code">s1.toLowerCase()</span>, and
                            <span class="code">s1.trim()</span>, note that the value of <span class="code">s1</span> is <b>not</b> changed. Instead
                            a new string is created and returned as the value of the function. The returned
                            value could be used, for example, in an assignment statement such as "<span class="code">smallLetters =
s1.toLowerCase();</span>".  To change the value of <span class="code">s1</span>, you could
                            use an assignment "<span class="code">s1 = s1.toLowerCase();</span>".</p>


                        


                        <p>Here is another extremely useful fact about strings: You can use the plus
                            operator, <span class="code">+</span>, to <code>concatenate</code> two strings. The
                            concatenation of two strings is a new string consisting of all the characters
                            of the first string followed by all the characters of the second string. For
                            example, <span class="code">"Hello" + "World"</span> evaluates to <span class="code">"HelloWorld"</span>. (Gotta watch those
                            spaces, of course&mdash;if you want a space in the concatenated string, it has to be
                            somewhere in the input data, as in <span class="code">"Hello&nbsp;" + "World"</span>.)</p>


                        <p>Let's suppose that <span class="code">name</span> is a variable of type
                            <em>String</em> and that it already refers to the name of the person using the
                            program. Then, the program could greet the user by executing the statement:</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">System.out.println("Hello, "  +  name  +  ".  Pleased to meet you!");</code></pre>


                        <p>Even more surprising is that you can actually concatenate values of <b>any</b>
                            type onto a <em>String</em> using the <span class="code">+</span> operator. The value
                            is converted to a string, just as it would be if you printed it
                            to the standard output, and then that string is concatenated with the other string. For
                            example, the expression <span class="code">"Number"&nbsp;+&nbsp;42</span> evaluates to the string <span class="code">"Number42"</span>. And
                            the statements</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">System.out.print("After ");
System.out.print(years);
System.out.print(" years, the value is ");
System.out.print(principal);</code></pre>


                        <p>can be replaced by the single statement:</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">System.out.print("After " + years +
                    " years, the value is " + principal);</code></pre>


                        <p>Obviously, this is very convenient. It would have shortened some of the
                            examples presented earlier in this chapter.</p>


                        <h3 id="mult-str"><a class="header" href="#mult-str">Text Blocks: Multiline Strings</a></h3>


                        <p>Representing long strings that extend over several lines can be tedious. The
                            end-of-line characters in the string can be represented by an escaped "n" (that is,
                            by&nbsp;<span class="code">\n</span>), and the full string could be broken into several parts
                            that are concatenated together using <span class="code">+</span> operators.  For example,</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">String poem = "As I was walking down the stair,\n"
    + "   I met a man who wasn't there.\n"
    + "He wasn't there again today.\n"
    + "   I wish, I wish he'd go away!";</code></pre>



                        <p>However, Java 17 defines a new kind of string literal that makes it easier
                            to represent multiline strings.  (Recall that a "literal" is something
                            you type in program to represent a constant
                            value.)  The new literals are called <code>text blocks</code>.
                            A text block starts with a string of three double-quote characters, followed
                            by optional white space and then a new line.  The white space and newline are
                            not part of the string constant that is represented by the text block.  The text block
                            is terminated by another string of three double-quote characters.  A text block
                            can be used anywhere an ordinary string literal could be used.  For example,</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">String poem = """
    As I was walking down the stair,
       I met a man who wasn't there.
    He wasn't there again today.
       I wish, I wish he'd go away!""";</code></pre>


                        <p>This is easier to write and to read than the previous way of writing the
                            value of <span class="code">poem</span>.</p>


                        <p>Remember that you can't have anything except white space (that is, spaces and tabs) on
                            the same line after the three double-quotes that start the text block.  Also,
                            note that any extra white space that occurs at the beginning of every line of the text block
                            is removed from the string that is represented by the literal.  In the example, the
                            first four spaces are removed from each line of the text block, but the three extra
                            spaces at the beginning of the second and fourth lines are not removed.
                            This means that you can indent the lines of the text block to match the indentation of your program,
                            without including that indentation in the string represented by the text block.</p>


                        <p>A text block can include escaped characters such as \t or \\, but aside
                            from the backslash character, '\', nothing in the text block has special
                            meaning.  For example, something in the text block that looks like a
                            Java comment is not actually a comment; it is just ordinary characters
                            that are part of the string.</p>

                            <span class="sourceref"><a href="./source/chapter2/TextBlockDemo.java">TextBlockDemo.java</a></span> is a short demo program that uses text blocks.</p>


                        <h3 id="enum"><a class="header" href="#enum">Introduction to Enums</a></h3>

                        <p>Java comes with eight built-in primitive types and a huge collection of types that
                            are defined by classes, such as <em>String</em>.  But even
                            this large collection of types is not sufficient to cover all the possible situations
                            that a programmer might have to deal with.  So, an essential part of Java, just like
                            almost any other programming language, is the ability to create <b>new</b> types.  For the
                            most part, this is done by defining new classes; you will learn how to do that
                            in <a href="ch05-00-ObjectsClasses.html">Chapter&nbsp;5</a>.  But, to give an example of defining a new type, we will look here at one particular case:
                            the ability to define <code>enums</code>.</p>


                        <p>Technically, an enum is considered to be a special kind of class, but that
                            is not important for now.  In this section, we will look at enums in a simplified
                            form.  In practice, most uses of enums will only need the simplified form
                            that is presented here.</p>


                        <p>An enum is a type that has a fixed list of possible values, which is specified
                            when the enum is created.  In some ways, an enum is similar to the <span class="ptype">boolean</span>
                            data type, which has <span class="code">true</span> and <span class="code">false</span> as its only possible
                            values.  However, <span class="ptype">boolean</span> is a primitive type, while an enum is not.</p>


                        <p>The definition of an enum type has the (simplified) form:</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">enum <span class="bnf">enum-type-name</span> { <span class="bnf">list-of-enum-values</span> }</code></pre>


                        <p>The definition can be in the same class as the program that uses it,
                            but outside the <span class="code">main()</span> routine, or it can be in a separate .java file.  (In Java 17, it is also possible to
                            put the definition inside <span class="code">main()</span>.) The <span class="bnf">enum-type-name</span> in the definition of
                            an enum can be any simple identifier.
                            This identifier becomes the name of the enum type, in the same way that "boolean" is the name of
                            the <span class="ptype">boolean</span> type and "String" is the name of the <em>String</em> type.
                            Each value in the <span class="bnf">list-of-enum-values</span> must be a simple identifier,
                            and the identifiers in the list are separated by commas.  For example, here is the definition
                            of an enum type named <em>Season</em> whose values are the names of the four seasons of the year:</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">enum Season { SPRING, SUMMER, FALL, WINTER }</code></pre>


                        <p>By convention, enum values are given names that are made up of upper case letters, but that is
                            a style guideline and not a syntax rule.  An enum value is a <code>constant</code>; that is,
                            it represents a fixed value that cannot be changed.  The possible values of an enum type are usually referred
                            to as <code>enum constants</code>.</p>


                        <p>Note that the enum constants of type <em>Season</em> are considered to be "contained in"
                            <em>Season</em>, which means&mdash;following the convention that compound identifiers
                            are used for things that are contained in other things&mdash;the names that you actually
                            use in your program to refer to them are <span class="code">Season.SPRING</span>, <span class="code">Season.SUMMER</span>,
                            <span class="code">Season.FALL</span>, and <span class="code">Season.WINTER</span>.</p>


                        <p>Once an enum type such as <em>Season</em> has been created, it can be used to declare variables in exactly
                            the same ways that other types are used.  For example, you can declare a variable
                            named <span class="code">vacation</span> of type <em>Season</em> with the statement:</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">Season vacation;</code></pre>


                        <p>After declaring the variable, you can assign a value to it using an assignment statement.
                            The value on the right-hand side of the assignment can be one of the enum constants of
                            type <span class="code">Season</span>.  Remember to use the full name of the constant, including
                            "Season"!  For example:</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">vacation = Season.SUMMER;</code></pre>


                        <p>You can print out an enum value with an output statement such as <span class="code">System.out.print(vacation)</span>.
                            The output value will be the name of the enum constant (without the "Season.").  In this case,
                            the output would be "SUMMER".</p>


                        <p>Because an enum is technically a class, the enum values are technically objects.  As objects,
                            they can contain subroutines.  One of the subroutines in every enum value is named <span class="code">ordinal()</span>.  When
                            used with an enum value, it returns the <code>ordinal number</code> of the value in the
                            list of values of the enum.  The ordinal number simply tells the position of the value in the list.
                            That is, <span class="code">Season.SPRING.ordinal()</span> is the <span class="ptype">int</span> value 0,
                            <span class="code">Season.SUMMER.ordinal()</span> is 1,
                            <span class="code">Season.FALL.ordinal()</span> is 2, and <span class="code">Season.WINTER.ordinal()</span> is&nbsp;3.  (You will see over
                            and over again that computer scientists like to start counting at zero!)  You can, of course, use
                            the <span class="code">ordinal()</span> method with a variable of type <em>Season</em>, such
                            as <span class="code">vacation.ordinal()</span>.</p>


                        <p>Using enums can make a program more readable, since you can use meaningful names for the values.
                            And it can prevent certain types of errors, since a compiler can check that the values assigned
                            to an enum variable are in fact legal values for that variable.
                            For now, you should just appreciate
                            them as the first example of an important concept: creating new types.
                            Here is a little example that shows enums being used in a complete program:</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">public class EnumDemo {

       // Define two enum types for use in this program.

    enum Day { SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY }

    enum Month { JAN, FEB, MAR, APR, MAY, JUN, JUL, AUG, SEP, OCT, NOV, DEC }

    public static void main(String[] args) {

         Day tgif;     // Declare a variable of type Day.
         Month libra;  // Declare a variable of type Month.

         tgif = Day.FRIDAY;    // Assign a value of type Day to tgif.
         libra = Month.OCT;    // Assign a value of type Month to libra.

         System.out.print("My sign is libra, since I was born in ");
         System.out.println(libra);   // Output value will be:  OCT
         System.out.print("That's the ");
         System.out.print( libra.ordinal() );
         System.out.println("-th month of the year.");
         System.out.println("   (Counting from 0, of course!)");

         System.out.print("Isn't it nice to get to ");
         System.out.println(tgif);   // Output value will be:  FRIDAY

         System.out.println( tgif + " is the " + tgif.ordinal()
                                            + "-th day of the week.");
    }

}</code></pre>


                        <p>(As I mentioned, an enum can actually be defined in a separate file.  The sample program
                            <span class="sourceref"><a href="./source/chapter2/SeparateEnumDemo.java">SeparateEnumDemo.java</a></span> is identical to <span class="sourceref"><a href="./source/chapter2/EnumDemo.java">EnumDemo.java</a></span>,
                            except that the enum types that it uses are defined in files named
                            <span class="sourceref"><a href="./source/chapter2/Month.java">Month.java</a></span> and <span class="sourceref"><a href="./source/chapter2/Day.java">Day.java</a></span>.)</p>
