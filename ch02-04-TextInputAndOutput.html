                        <p>
                            We have seen that it is very easy to display
                            text to the user with the functions <span class="code">System.out.print</span> and <span class="code">System.out.println</span>.
                            But there is more to say on the topic of outputting text.  Furthermore, most programs
                            use data that is input to the program at run time rather than built into the program.
                            So you need to know how to do input
                            as well as output.  This section explains how to get
                            data from the user, and it covers output in more detail than we have seen so far. It also
                            has a section on using files for input and output.
                        </p>


                        <h3 id="basicio"><a class="header" href="#basicio">Basic Output and Formatted Output</a></h3>


                        <p>The most basic output function is <span class="code">System.out.print(x)</span>, where <span class="code">x</span>
                            can be a value or expression of any type.  If the parameter, <span class="code">x</span>, is not already
                            a string, it is converted to a value of type <em>String</em>, and the string
                            is then output to the destination called <span class="newword">standard output</span>.  (Generally,
                            this means that the string is displayed to the user; however, in GUI programs, it
                            outputs to a place where a typical user is unlikely to see it.  Furthermore, standard
                            output can be "redirected" to write to a different output destination.  Nevertheless,
                            for the type of program that we are working with now, the purpose of <span class="code">System.out</span>
                            is to display text to the user.)</p>


                        <p>
                            <span class="code">System.out.println(x)</span> outputs the same text as <span class="code">System.out.print</span>,
                            but it follows that text by a line feed, which means that any subsequent output will be on the
                            next line.  It is possible to use this function with no parameter, <span class="code">System.out.println()</span>,
                            which outputs nothing but a line feed.  Note that <span class="code">System.out.println(x)</span> is equivalent
                            to</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">System.out.print(x);
System.out.println();</code></pre>


                        <p>You might have noticed that <span class="code">System.out.print</span> outputs real numbers with
                            as many digits after the decimal point as necessary, so that for example π is output
                            as 3.141592653589793, and numbers that are supposed to represent money might be output
                            as 1050.0 or 43.575.  You might prefer to have these numbers output as, for example,
                            3.14159, 1050.00, and 43.58.
                            Java has a "formatted output" capability that makes it easy
                            to control how real numbers and other values are printed.  A lot of formatting options
                            are available.  I will cover just a few of the simplest and most commonly used
                            possibilities here.</p>


                        <p>The function <span class="code">System.out.printf</span> can be used to produce formatted
                            output.  (The name "printf," which stands for "print formatted," is copied from
                            the C and C++ programming languages, where this type of output originated.)
                            <span class="code">System.out.printf</span> takes one or more parameters.
                            The first parameter is a <em>String</em> that specifies the format of the
                            output.  This parameter is called the <span class="newword">format string</span>.
                            The remaining parameters specify the values that are to be output.  Here is
                            a statement that will print a number in the proper format for a dollar amount,
                            where <span class="code">amount</span> is a variable of type <span class="ptype">double</span>:
                        </p>


                        <pre><code class="java">System.out.printf( "%1.2f", amount );</code></pre>



                        <p>The output format for a value is given by a <span class="newword">format specifier</span> in the format string.
                            In this example, the format specifier is <span class="code">%1.2f</span>.
                            The format string (in the simple cases that I cover here) contains one format specifier for
                            each of the values that is to be output.  Some typical format specifiers are
                            <span class="code">%d</span>, <span class="code">%12d</span>, <span class="code">%10s</span>, <span class="code">%1.2f</span>, <span class="code">%15.8e</span> and <span class="code">%1.8g</span>.
                            Every format specifier begins with a percent sign (<span class="code">%</span>) and ends with a letter, possibly with
                            some extra formatting information in between.  The letter specifies the type of output
                            that is to be produced.  For example, in <span class="code">%d</span> and <span class="code">%12d</span>,
                            the "d" specifies that an integer is to be written.  The "12" in <span class="code">%12d</span>
                            specifies the minimum number of spaces that should be used for the output.  If the
                            integer that is being output takes up fewer than 12 spaces, extra blank spaces
                            are added in front of the integer to bring the total up to 12.  We say that the
                            output is "right-justified in a field of length 12."  A very large value is not forced into
                            12 spaces; if the value has more than 12 digits, all the digits will be printed, with
                            no extra spaces.  The specifier <span class="code">%d</span> means the same as <span class="code">%1d</span>&mdash;that is,
                            an integer will be printed using just as many spaces as necessary.
                            (The "d," by the way, stands for "decimal"&mdash;that is, base-10&mdash;numbers.  You can replace the "d" with an "x" to
                            output an integer value in hexadecimal form.)
                        </p>


                        <p>The letter "s" in a format specifier can be used with any type of value.
                            It means that the value should be output in its default format, just as it would be
                            in unformatted output.  A number, such as the "20" in <span class="code">%20s</span>, can
                            be added to specify the (minimum) number of characters.  The "s" stands for "string,"
                            and it can be used for values of type <em>String</em>.  It can also be used
                            for values of other types; in that case the value is converted into a <em>String</em>
                            value in the usual way.</p>


                        <p>The format specifiers for values of type <span class="ptype">double</span> are more complicated.
                            An "f", as in <span class="code">%1.2f</span>, is used to output a number in "floating-point" form,
                            that is with digits after a decimal point.  In <span class="code">%1.2f</span>, the "2" specifies
                            the number of digits to use after the decimal point.  The "1" specifies the (minimum)
                            number of characters to output; a "1" in this position effectively means that just as many characters
                            as are necessary should be used.  Similarly, <span class="code">%12.3f</span> would specify a
                            floating-point format with 3 digits after the decimal point, right-justified in a
                            field of length 12.</p>


                        <p>Very large and very small numbers should be written in exponential format, such
                            as 6.00221415e23, representing "6.00221415 times 10 raised to the power 23."
                            A format specifier such as <span class="code">%15.8e</span> specifies an output in exponential
                            form, with the "8" telling how many digits to use after the decimal point.
                            If you use "g" instead of "e", the output will be in exponential form for
                            very small values and very large values and in floating-point form for other values.  In <span class="code">%1.8g</span>,
                            the 8 gives the total number of digits in the answer, including both the
                            digits before the decimal point and the digits after the decimal point.</p>


                        <p>For numeric output, the format specifier can include a comma&nbsp;(","),
                            which will cause the digits of the number to be separated into groups, to
                            make it easier to read big numbers.  In the United States, groups of three
                            digits are separated by commas.  For example, if <span class="code">x</span> is one billion,
                            then <span class="code">System.out.printf("%,d",x)</span> will output 1,000,000,000.
                            In other countries, the separator character and the
                            number of digits per group might be different.  The comma should come at the
                            beginning of the format specifier, before the field width; for example:
                            <span class="code">%,12.3f</span>.  If you want the output to be left-justified instead of
                            right justified, add a minus sign to the beginning of the format specifier:
                            for example, <span class="code">%-20s</span>.
                        </p>


                        <p>In addition to format specifiers, the format string in a <span class="code">printf</span> statement
                            can include other characters.  These extra characters are just copied to the
                            output.  This can be a convenient way to insert values into the middle of an
                            output string.  For example, if <span class="code">x</span> and <span class="code">y</span> are variables
                            of type <span class="ptype">int</span>, you could say</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">System.out.printf("The product of %d and %d is %d", x, y, x*y);</code></pre>


                        <p>When this statement is executed, the value of <span class="code">x</span> is substituted for the
                            first <span class="code">%d</span> in the string, the value of <span class="code">y</span> for the second
                            <span class="code">%d</span>, and the value of the expression <span class="code">x*y</span> for the third,
                            so the output would be something like "The product of 17 and 42 is 714" (quotation
                            marks not included in output!).
                        </p>


                        <p>To include an actual percent sign in the output, use the format specifier <span class="code">%%</span> in the format
                            string.  You can use <span class="code">%n</span> to output a line feed.  You can also use
                            a backslash, <span class="code">\</span>, as usual in strings to output special characters
                            such as tabs and double quote characters.</p>


                        <p>The format string in a <span class="code">System.printf</span> statement can be given by a
                            text block, which makes it easier to output multiple lines of text.  For example,</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">System.out.printf("""
        The equivalent of %d miles is:
            %,d yards,
            %,d feet, or
            %,d inches
        """, miles, 1760*miles, 5280*miles, 12*5280*miles);</code></pre>

                        <h3 id="firstio"><a class="header" href="#firstio">A First Text Input Example</a></h3>

                        <p>For some unfathomable reason, Java
                            has traditionally made it difficult to read data typed in by the user of a program.
                            You've already seen that output can be displayed to the user using the
                            subroutine <span class="code">System.out.print</span>. This subroutine is part of a predefined
                            object called <span class="code">System.out</span>. The purpose of this object is precisely to
                            display output to the user.  There is a corresponding object called
                            <span class="code">System.in</span> that exists to read data input by the user, but it provides
                            only very primitive input facilities, and it requires some advanced Java
                            programming skills to use it effectively.</p>


                        <p>Java 5.0 finally made input a little easier with a
                            new <em>Scanner</em> class. However, it requires some knowledge of
                            object-oriented programming to use this class, so it's not ideal for use
                            here at the beginning of this course.  Java&nbsp;6 introduced the <em>Console</em>
                            class for communicating with the user, but <em>Console</em>
                            has its own problems. (It is not always available, and it can only read
                            strings, not numbers.)  Furthermore, in my opinion,
                            <em>Scanner</em> and <em>Console</em> still don't get things quite right.
                            Nevertheless, I will introduce <em>Scanner</em> briefly at the end of this
                            section, in case you want to start using it now.  However, we start with my own version
                            of text input.</p>


                        <p>Fortunately, it is possible to <b>extend</b> Java by
                            creating new classes that provide subroutines that are not available in the
                            standard part of the language. As soon as a new class is
                            available, the subroutines that it contains can be used in exactly the same way
                            as built-in routines.  Along these lines, I've written a class named <em>TextIO</em> that defines
                            subroutines for reading values typed by the user. The subroutines in this class
                            make it possible to get input from the standard input object,
                            <span class="code">System.in</span>, without knowing about the advanced aspects of Java that are
                            needed to use <em>Scanner</em>
                            or to use <span class="code">System.in</span> directly.</p>


                        <p>
                            <em>TextIO</em> is defined in a "package" named <em>TextIO</em>.
                            This means that when you look for the file <span class="code">TextIO.java</span>, you will find it inside
                            a folder named <em>TextIO</em>.  Furthermore, it means that a program that uses
                            <em>TextIO</em> must "import" it from the <em>TextIO</em> package.
                            This is done with the import directive
                        </p>


                        <pre><code class="java">import textio.TextIO;</code></pre>


                        <p>This directive must come before the "public class" that begins your program.  Most of
                            Java's standard classes, including <em>Scanner</em>,
                            are defined in packages and are imported into programs in the same way.</p>


                        <p>Because <em>TextIO</em> is not a built-in part of Java, you must make sure that the
                            <em>TextIO</em> class is
                            available to your program. What this means depends on the Java programming
                            environment that you are using.  In general, you just have to
                            add the folder <span class="sourceref"><a href="file:///source/chapter2/textio/">textio</a></span> to the same folder that contains
                            your main program.  This folder contains the file <span class="sourceref"><a href="./source/chapter2/textio/TextIO.java">TextIO.java</a></span>.
                            See <a href="ch02-06-ProgrammingEnvironments.html">Section&nbsp;2.6</a> for information about how to use <em>TextIO</em>.</p>


                        <p>The input routines in the <em>TextIO</em> class are static member functions.
                            (Static member functions were introduced in the <a href="ch02-03-ObjectsAndSubroutines.html">previous section</a>.)
                            Let's suppose that you want your program to read an integer typed
                            in by the user. The <em>TextIO</em> class contains a static member function
                            named <span class="code">getlnInt</span> that you can use for this purpose. Since this function is
                            contained in the <em>TextIO</em> class, you have to refer to it in your program
                            as <span class="code">TextIO.getlnInt</span>. The function has no parameters, so a complete call to the
                            function takes the form "<span class="code">TextIO.getlnInt()</span>". This function call
                            represents the <span class="ptype">int</span> value typed by the user, and you have to do
                            something with the returned value, such as assign it to a variable. For
                            example, if <span class="code">userInput</span> is a variable of type <span class="ptype">int</span> (created with
                            a declaration statement "<span class="code">int&nbsp;userInput;</span>"), then you could use the
                            assignment statement</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">userInput = TextIO.getlnInt();</code></pre>


                        <p>When the computer executes this statement, it will wait for the user to type
                            in an integer value. The user must type a number and press return before the program can
                            continue.  The value that the user typed will then be returned by the function, and it
                            will be stored in the variable, <span class="code">userInput</span>. Here is a complete program
                            that uses <span class="code">TextIO.getlnInt</span> to read a number typed by the user and then
                            prints out the square of that number.  Note the <span class="code">import</span> directive on the
                            first line:</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">import textio.TextIO;

/**
 * A program that reads an integer that is typed in by the
 * user and computes and prints the square of that integer.
 */
public class PrintSquare {

     public static void main(String[] args) {

        int userInput;  // The number input by the user.
        int square;     // The userInput, multiplied by itself.

        System.out.print("Please type a number: ");
        userInput = TextIO.getlnInt();
        square = userInput * userInput;

        System.out.println();
        System.out.println("The number that you entered was " + userInput);
        System.out.println("The square of that number is " + square);
        System.out.println();

     } // end of main()

} //end of class PrintSquare</code></pre>


                        <p>When you run this program, it
                            will display the message "Please type a number:" and will pause until you type
                            a response, including a carriage return after the number.  Note that it is
                            good style to output a question or some other prompt to the user before reading
                            input.  Otherwise, the user will have no way of knowing exactly what the
                            computer is waiting for, or even that it is waiting for the user to do something.
                        </p>

                        <h3 id="basiciofunc"><a class="header" href="#basiciofunc">Basic TextIO Input Functions</a></h3>


                        <p>
                            <em>TextIO</em> includes a variety of functions for inputting values
                            of various types.  Here are the functions that you are
                            most likely to use:</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">j = TextIO.getlnInt();     // Reads a value of type int.
y = TextIO.getlnDouble();  // Reads a value of type double.
a = TextIO.getlnBoolean(); // Reads a value of type boolean.
c = TextIO.getlnChar();    // Reads a value of type char.
w = TextIO.getlnWord();    // Reads one "word" as a value of type String.
s = TextIO.getln();        // Reads an entire input line as a String.</code></pre>


                        <p>For these statements to be legal, the variables on the left side of each
                            assignment statement must already be declared and must be of the same type as
                            that returned by the function on the right side.  Note carefully that
                            these functions do not have parameters.  The values that they return come
                            from outside the program, typed in by the user as the program is running.
                            To "capture" that data so that you can use it in your program, you have
                            to assign the return value of the function to a variable.  You will then
                            be able to refer to the user's input value by using the name of the variable.</p>


                        <p>When you call one of these functions, you are guaranteed that it will return
                            a legal value of the correct type. If the user types in an illegal value as
                            input&mdash;for example, if you ask for an <span class="ptype">int</span> and the user types in a
                            non-numeric character or a
                            number that is outside the legal range of values that can be stored
                            in a variable of type <span class="ptype">int</span>&mdash;then the computer will
                            ask the user to re-enter the value, and your program never sees the first,
                            illegal value that the user entered.  For <span class="code">TextIO.getlnBoolean()</span>,
                            the user is allowed to type in any of the following: true, false, t, f, yes, no, y,
                            n, 1, or 0.  Furthermore, they can use either upper or lower case letters.
                            In any case, the user's input is interpreted as a true/false value.  It's
                            convenient to use <span class="code">TextIO.getlnBoolean()</span> to read the user's
                            response to a Yes/No question.</p>


                        <p>You'll notice that there are two input functions that return Strings. The
                            first, <span class="code">getlnWord()</span>, returns a string consisting of non-blank characters
                            only. When it is called, it skips over any spaces and carriage returns typed in
                            by the user. Then it reads non-blank characters until it gets to the next space
                            or carriage return. It returns a <em>String</em> consisting of all the
                            non-blank characters that it has read. The second input function,
                            <span class="code">getln()</span>, simply returns a string consisting of all the characters
                            typed in by the user, including spaces, up to the next carriage return. It gets
                            an entire line of input text. The carriage return itself is not returned as
                            part of the input string, but it is read and discarded by the computer. Note
                            that the String returned by <span class="code">TextIO.getln()</span> might be the <span class="newword">empty string</span>,
                            <span class="code">""</span>, which contains no characters at
                            all.  You will get this return value if the user simply presses return, without
                            typing anything else first.</p>


                        <p>
                            <span class="code">TextIO.getln()</span> does <b>not</b> skip blanks
                            or end-of-lines before reading a value.  But the input functions <span class="code">getlnInt()</span>,
                            <span class="code">getlnDouble()</span>, <span class="code">getlnBoolean()</span>, and
                            <span class="code">getlnChar()</span> behave like <span class="code">getlnWord()</span> in that they will skip
                            past any blanks and carriage returns in the input before reading a value.  When one
                            of these functions skips over an end-of-line, it outputs a '?' to let the user know
                            that more input is expected.</p>


                        <p>Furthermore, if the user types extra characters on the line after the
                            input value, <b>all the extra characters will be discarded, along with
                                the carriage return at the end of the line</b>.  If the
                            program executes another input function, the user will have to type in
                            another line of input, even if they had typed more than one value on the previous line.
                            It might not sound like a good idea to discard any
                            of the user's input, but it turns out to be the safest thing to do in most
                            programs.</p>


                        


                        <p>Using <em>TextIO</em> for input and output, we can now improve the program
                            from <a href="ch02-02-VariablesAndTypes.html">Section&nbsp;2.2</a> for computing the value of an investment.
                            We can have the user type in the initial value of the investment and the
                            interest rate. The result is a much more useful program&mdash;for one thing, it
                            makes sense to run it more than once!  Note that this program uses formatted
                            output to print out monetary values in their correct format.</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">import textio.TextIO;

public class Interest2 {

                        <p>(You might be wondering why there is only one output routine, <span class="code">System.out.println</span>,
                            which can output data values of any type, while there is a
                            separate input routine for each data type. For the output function, the computer can
                            tell what type of value is being output by looking at the parameter.  However, the input
                            routines don't have parameters, so the different input routines can only be
                            distinguished by having different names.)</p>

                        <h3 id="introfileio"><a class="header" href="#introfileio">Introduction to File I/O</a></h3>

                        <p>
                            <span class="code">System.out</span> sends its output to the output destination known as
                            "standard output."  But standard output is just one possible output destination.
                            For example, data can be written to a <span class="newword">file</span> that
                            is stored on the user's hard drive.  The advantage to this, of course, is that
                            the data is saved in the file even after the program ends, and the user can
                            print the file, email it to someone else, edit it with another program, and so
                            on.  Similarly, <span class="code">System.in</span> has only one possible source for input
                            data.</p>


                        <p>
                            <em>TextIO</em> has the ability to write data to files and to read data
                            from files.  <em>TextIO</em> includes output functions
                            <span class="code">TextIO.put</span>, <span class="code">TextIO.putln</span>, and <span class="code">TextIO.putf</span>.
                            Ordinarily, these functions work exactly like
                            <span class="code">System.out.print</span>, <span class="code">System.out.println</span>, and
                            <span class="code">System.out.printf</span> and are interchangeable with them.
                            However, they can also be used to output text to files and to other destinations.</p>


                        <p>When you write output using <span class="code">TextIO.put</span>, <span class="code">TextIO.putln</span>,
                            or <span class="code">TextIO.putf</span>, the output is sent to
                            the <span class="newword">current output destination.</span>  By default,
                            the current output destination is standard output.  However, <em>TextIO</em>
                            has subroutines that can be used to <b>change</b> the current output destination.
                            To write to a file named "result.txt", for example, you would use the statement:</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">TextIO.writeFile("result.txt");</code></pre>

                            statements will be sent to the file named "result.txt" instead of to standard

                            Note that if a file with the same name already exists, its previous

                        <p>When you call <span class="code">TextIO.writeFile</span>, <em>TextIO</em>
                            remembers the file and automatically sends any output from <span class="code">TextIO.put</span>
                            or other output functions to that file.  If you want to go back to writing to

                        <p>Here is a simple program that asks the user some
                            questions and outputs the user's responses to a file named
                            "profile.txt."  As an example, it uses <em>TextIO</em> for
                            output to standard output as well as to the file, but <span class="code">System.out</span>
                            could also have been used for the output to standard output.</p>

                        <p>In many cases, you want to let the user select
                            the file that will be used for output.  You could ask the user to type in the
                            file name, but that is error-prone, and users are more familiar with
                            selecting a file from a file dialog box.  The statement</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">TextIO.writeUserSelectedFile();</code></pre>


                        <p>will open a typical graphical-user-interface file selection dialog where
                            the user can specify the output file.  This also has the advantage of alerting the
                            user if they are about to replace an existing file.  It is possible for the
                            user to cancel the dialog box without selecting a file.  <span class="code">TextIO.writeUserSelectedFile</span>
                            is a function that returns a <span class="ptype">boolean</span> value.  The return value is <span class="code">true</span>
                            if the user selected a file, and is <span class="code">false</span> if the user canceled the dialog box.
                            Your program can check the return value if it needs to know whether it is actually going
                            to write to a file or not.</p>


                        


                        <p>
                            <em>TextIO</em> can also read from files, as an alternative to
                            reading from standard input.
                            You can specify an input source for <em>TextIO's</em> various
                            "get" functions.  The default input source is standard input.  You can use
                            the statement <span class="code">TextIO.readFile("data.txt")</span> to read from
                            a file named "data.txt" instead, or you can let the user select the
                            input file with a GUI-style dialog box by saying <span class="code">TextIO.readUserSelectedFile()</span>.
                            After you have done this, any input will come from the file instead of being
                            typed by the user.  You can go back to reading the user's input with
                            <span class="code">TextIO.readStandardInput()</span>.</p>


                        <p>When your program is reading from standard input, the user gets
                            a chance to correct any errors in the input.  This is not possible
                            when the program is reading from a file.  If illegal data is found
                            when a program tries to read from a file, an error occurs that
                            will crash the program. (Later, we will see that it is possible
                            to "catch" such errors and recover from them.)  Errors can also
                            occur, though more rarely, when writing to files.</p>


                        <p>A complete understanding of input/output in Java requires
                            a knowledge of object oriented programming.  We will return to
                            the topic later, in <a href="ch11-00-IOStreamsFilesNetworking.html">Chapter&nbsp;11</a>.
                            The file I/O capabilities in the <em>TextIO</em> class are rather
                            primitive by comparison.  Nevertheless, they are sufficient
                            for many applications, and they will allow you to get some
                            experience with files sooner rather than later.</p>

                        <h3 id="othertext-io"><a class="header" href="#othertext-io">Other TextIO Features</a></h3>

                        <p>The <em>TextIO</em> input functions that we have seen so
                            far can only read one value from a line of input.
                            Sometimes, however, you do want to read more than one value
                            from the same line of input.  For example, you might want the
                            user to be able to type something like "42&nbsp;17" to input the
                            two numbers 42 and 17 on the same line.
                            <em>TextIO</em> provides the following
                            alternative input functions to allow you to do this:</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">j = TextIO.getInt();     // Reads a value of type int.
y = TextIO.getDouble();  // Reads a value of type double.
a = TextIO.getBoolean(); // Reads a value of type boolean.
c = TextIO.getChar();    // Reads a value of type char.
w = TextIO.getWord();    // Reads one "word" as a value of type String.</code></pre>


                        <p>The names of these functions start with "get" instead of "getln".
                            "Getln" is short for "get line" and should remind you that the functions
                            whose names begin with "getln" will consume an entire line of data.  A function
                            without the "ln" will read an input value in the same way, but will then
                            save the rest of the input line in a  chunk of internal memory
                            called the  <span class="newword">input buffer</span>.
                            The next time the computer wants to read an input value, it will look
                            in the input buffer before prompting the user for input.  This allows the
                            computer to read several values from one line of the user's input.
                            Strictly speaking, the computer actually reads <b>only</b> from the input buffer.
                            The first time the program tries to read input from the user, the
                            computer will wait while the user types in an entire line of
                            input. <em>TextIO</em> stores that line in the input buffer until
                            the data on the line has been read or discarded (by one of the "getln"
                            functions).  The user only gets to
                            type when the buffer is empty.</p>


                        <p>Previously, I said that <span class="code">TextIO.getln()</span> reads a full line of input.
                            Given the way that <em>TextIO</em> uses the input buffer, that is not
                            quite true.   In fact, if <span class="code">TextIO.getln()</span> is called when the buffer is not
                            empty, then it  will simply return whatever characters remain in the buffer without
                            getting a new line of input from the user.  If you ever want to empty the input buffer
                            and simply discard the input, you can call <span class="code">TextIO.getln()</span> as a subroutine,
                            without assigning the returned value to a variable:</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">TextIO.getln();</code></pre>


                        <p>Note, by the way, that although most <em>TextIO</em> input functions will
                            skip past blank spaces and carriage returns while looking for input, they will
                            <b>not</b> skip past other characters.  For example, if you try
                            to read two <span class="ptype">ints</span> and the user types "42,17", the computer will read the
                            first number correctly, but when it tries to read the second number, it will
                            see the comma. It will regard this as an error and will force the user to
                            retype the number. If you want to input several numbers from one line, you
                            should make sure that the user knows to separate them with spaces, not commas.
                            Alternatively, if you want to <b>require</b> a comma between the numbers, use
                            <span class="code">getChar()</span> to read the comma before reading the second number.</p>


                        <p>There is another character input function, <span class="code">TextIO.getAnyChar()</span>,
                            which does not skip past blanks or carriage returns. It simply reads and
                            returns the next character typed by the user, even if it's a blank or
                            carriage return. If the user typed a carriage return,
                            then the <span class="ptype">char</span> returned by <span class="code">getAnyChar()</span> is the special linefeed
                            character '\n'. There is also a function, <span class="code">TextIO.peek()</span>, that lets
                            you look ahead at the next character in the input without actually reading it.
                            After you "peek" at the next character, it will still be there when you read
                            the next item from input. This allows you to look ahead and see what's coming
                            up in the input, so that you can take different actions depending on what's
                            there.</p>


                        <p>The <em>TextIO</em> class provides a number of other functions.  To
                            learn more about them, you can look at the comments in the source code file,
                            <span class="sourceref"><a href="./source/chapter2/textio/TextIO.java">TextIO.java</a></span>.</p>


                        <p>Clearly, the semantics of input is much more complicated than the semantics of output!
                            Fortunately, for the majority of applications, it's pretty straightforward in practice.
                            You only need to follow the details if you want to do something fancy.  In particular,
                            I <b>strongly</b> advise you to use the "getln" versions of
                            the input routines, rather than the "get" versions, unless you really want to
                            read several items from the same line of input, precisely because the semantics
                            of the "getln" versions is much simpler.
                        </p>

                        <h3 id="scannerio"><a class="header" href="#scannerio">Using Scanner for Input</a></h3>

                        <p>
                            <em>TextIO</em> makes it easy to get input from the user.
                            However, since it is not a standard class, you have to remember to make
                            <span class="code">TextIO.java</span> available to any program that uses it.  Another option for input
                            is the <em>Scanner</em> class.
                            One advantage of using <em>Scanner</em> is that it's
                            a standard part of Java and so is always there when you want it.</p>


                        <p>It's not that hard to use a <em>Scanner</em> for user input, and it has
                            some nice features, but using it requires some
                            syntax that will not be introduced until <a href="ch04-00-Subroutines.html">Chapter&nbsp;4</a> and
                            <a href="ch05-00-ObjectsClasses.html">Chapter&nbsp;5</a>.  I'll tell you how to do it here, without explaining why
                            it works.  You won't understand all the syntax at this point.
                            (<em>Scanners</em> will be covered in more detail in <a href="ch11-01-IOStreamsReadersAndWriters.html">Subsection&nbsp;11.1.5</a>.)</p>


                        <p>First, since <em>Scanner</em> is defined in the package <em>java.util</em>,
                            you should add the following
                            import directive to your program at the beginning of the source code file, before the "public class...":</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">import java.util.Scanner;</code></pre>


                        <p>Then include the following statement at the beginning of your <span class="code">main()</span> routine:</p>


                        <pre><code class="java">Scanner stdin = new Scanner( System.in );</code></pre>


                        <p>This creates a variable named <span class="code">stdin</span> of type <em>Scanner</em>.
                            (You can use a different name for the variable if you want; "stdin" stands for "standard input.")
                            You can then use <span class="code">stdin</span> in your program to access a variety of subroutines for
                            reading user input.  For example, the function <span class="code">stdin.nextInt()</span> reads one value of type
                            <span class="ptype">int</span> from the user and returns it.  It is almost the same as <span class="code">TextIO.getInt()</span>
                            except for two things:  If the value entered by the user is not a legal <span class="ptype">int</span>, then
                            <span class="code">stdin.nextInt()</span> will crash rather than prompt the user to re-enter the value.
                            And the integer entered by the user must be followed by a blank space or by an end-of-line,
                            whereas <span class="code">TextIO.getInt()</span> will stop reading at any character that is not a digit.
                        </p>


                        <p>There are corresponding methods for reading other types of data, including
                            <span class="code">stdin.nextDouble()</span>, <span class="code">stdin.nextLong()</span>, and <span class="code">stdin.nextBoolean()</span>.
                            (<span class="code">stdin.nextBoolean()</span> will only accept "true" or "false" as input.)  These subroutines
                            can read more than one value from a line, so they are more similar to the "get" versions of
                            <em>TextIO</em> subroutines rather than the "getln" versions.  The method
                            <span class="code">stdin.nextLine()</span> is equivalent to <span class="code">TextIO.getln()</span>, and
                            <span class="code">stdin.next()</span>, like <span class="code">TextIO.getWord()</span>, returns a string of
                            non-blank characters.</p>


                        <p>As a simple example, here is a version of the sample program <span class="sourceref"><a href="./source/chapter2/Interest2.java">Interest2.java</a></span>
                            that uses <em>Scanner</em> instead of <em>TextIO</em> for user
                            input:
                        </p>


                        <pre><code class="java">
<span class="newcode">import java.util.Scanner;</span>

public class Interest2WithScanner {

   public static void main(String[] args) {

      <span class="newcode">Scanner stdin = new Scanner( System.in );</span>  // Create the Scanner.

      double principal;  // The value of the investment.
      double rate;       // The annual interest rate.
      double interest;   // The interest earned during the year.

      System.out.print("Enter the initial investment: ");
      <span class="newcode">principal = stdin.nextDouble();</span>

      System.out.print("Enter the annual interest rate (as a decimal): ");
      <span class="newcode">rate = stdin.nextDouble();</span>

      interest = principal * rate;       // Compute this year's interest.
      principal = principal + interest;  // Add it to principal.

      System.out.printf("The amount of interest is $%1.2f%n", interest);
      System.out.printf("The value after one year is $%1.2f%n", principal);

   } // end of main()

} // end of class Interest2WithScanner</code></pre>


                        <p>Note the inclusion of the two lines given above to import <span class="code">Scanner</span> and
                            create <span class="code">stdin</span>.  Also note the substitution of
                            <span class="code">stdin.nextDouble()</span> for <span class="code">TextIO.getlnDouble()</span>.  (In fact,
                            <span class="code">stdin.nextDouble()</span> is really equivalent to <span class="code">TextIO.getDouble()</span>
                            rather than to the "getln" version, but this will not affect the behavior of the
                            program as long as the user types just one number on each line of input.)</p>


                        <p>I will continue to use <em>TextIO</em> for input for the time
                            being, but I will give a few more examples of using <em>Scanner</em>
                            in the on-line solutions to the end-of-chapter exercises.  There will be more
                            detailed coverage of <em>Scanner</em> later in the book.</p>
