a simplified or higher level interface to a complex system.  It is closely related
to the idea of a "black box." Abstraction makes it possible to understand or
use a system, while ignoring some of the details of what actually goes on in the
system.  For example, control abstractions such as if statements and while
loops are actually implemented in machine language by jump and conditional jump
instructions, but it is possible&mdash;and easier&mdash;to use if statements
and while loops without knowing anything about their machine language implementation.
Control abstractions make it possible to implement algorithms on a higher level
than machine language.  Abstraction is a fundamental concept in computer science.</span>
